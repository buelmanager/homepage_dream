# Originality Report — Salinae Atelier (sea-salt-atelier)

## Brand

- **Brand name:** Salinae — original (Latin: salt pans/salt works — coined for this project)
- **Founder:** Margaux Delval — fictional character
- **Tagline:** "Where the Ocean Crystallises Into Art" — original
- **Twelve-pond gradient system:** original description (inspired by real paludier science, implementation details are fictional)

## Visual Design

- Color palette: Original deep ocean-teal combination
- Layout: Type D hero is original implementation; split-screen portrait+stats is uncommon in artisan food
- Philosophy grid: 2px gap mosaic style — original treatment
- Collection grid: Mixed aspect ratios (portrait top row, landscape bottom row) — original choice

## Copy

All body copy is 100% original. The biochemical claims (84 trace minerals) are inspired by real artisan sea salt science but all specific numbers, names, and narratives are fictional.

## Images

All images from confirmed-valid Unsplash ID list. Unsplash license permits commercial and editorial use.

## Code

- CSS architecture: Original, distinct from raw-honey despite shared structural approach
- Fonts: Different from raw-honey (Playfair + Raleway vs Cormorant + Cinzel)
- Hero layout: Type D implementation is entirely different from Type B used in raw-honey

## Verdict

Original luxury landing page. Inspired by the artisan sea salt category but does not copy any existing brand's structure, copy, visual identity, or code.
