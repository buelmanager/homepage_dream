# Clone Plan — Salinae Atelier (sea-salt-atelier)

## Reference Research

- **Fleur de Sel de Guérande** — traditional Breton salt, provenance positioning
- **The Meadow Salt** (Portland) — artisan salt retail language
- **SaltWorks** — professional/culinary positioning
- **Love Sea Salt** — educational content approach

## Design Decisions

### Why Portrait + Stats Hero (Type D)?
The large numerical statistics (7 days, 3 oceans, 0 additives) communicate credibility and specificity in the very first view. This creates immediate trust through data — unusual for artisan food brands which typically lead with emotive imagery alone. The portrait on the right provides the emotional anchor. Together they say: "precise science, beautiful result."

### Color Palette Rationale
Deep ocean night (`#151C22`) is cooler and denser than a typical luxury dark. The teal-blue (`#4A8FA8`) references the ocean directly — not romantically (no turquoise) but mineralically (the blue of deep water, not shallow). The salt white (`#E8EDF0`) has a slight blue-grey tinge — the visual quality of a sea salt crystal in light.

### Gradient System as Narrative Core
The twelve-pond gradient system is not just a process detail — it is the central brand story. By structuring the process page around the five stages of this system, we transform an industrial concept into an artisanal ritual.

### "Enquire, Don't Buy" Commerce Model
Like Aurea Mellis honey, Salinae does not use e-commerce language. "Enquire" and "Request" rather than "Add to Cart" — positions the brand as allocated rather than mass-available.
