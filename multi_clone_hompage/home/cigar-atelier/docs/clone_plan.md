- **Typography**: Cinzel (display) + Cormorant Garamond (body) + Inter (UI)
- **Hero Type**: Type F — Interactive mousemove depth parallax
- **Signature elements**: Custom CSS cursor in hero, `filter: sepia()` on images, dot-based scroll indicators, tobacco-ember depth layering

## Pages
1. `index.html` — Preloader + 13 mandatory sections with mousemove parallax hero
2. `about.html` — Founder story, torcedores team (3-col), four pillars
3. `collection.html` — Vitola collection (horizontal rows) + 6 wrapper origins with colour swatches
4. `process.html` — 5 alternating image/text stages from seed to aging vault
5. `contact.html` — Geneva + London salon cards + patron application form
