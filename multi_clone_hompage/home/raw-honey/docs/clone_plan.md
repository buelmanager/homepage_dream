# Clone Plan — Aurea Mellis (raw-honey)

## Reference Brands Studied

- **Mielle Organics** — warmth-driven brand storytelling
- **Fortnum & Mason Honey** — heritage provenance language
- **Hive & Keeper** — small-batch apiculture positioning
- **L'Apiculteur** — French artisan aesthetic

## Design Decisions

### Why Parallax Hero (Type B)?
Honey has a viscous, slow, heavy quality. The parallax effect mimics that — the landscape seems to pour slowly as you scroll, creating a sensory analogue to the product itself.

### Color Palette Rationale
Deep warm charcoal (`#1E1A14`) evokes raw beeswax and dark amber. Gold (`#C9A84C`) is not bright or yellow — it's the deep, oxidized gold of dark forest honeydew. The palette avoids yellows entirely to sidestep cliché.

### Typography Choice
- Cinzel for the brand name — classical Roman inscriptions, timelessness, authority
- Cormorant Garamond for body display — romance, terroir, European artisan tradition
- Inter for UI — neutral, precise, laboratory-quality

### Section Structure Innovation
Rather than a standard "about / products / contact" flow, we use:
1. Parallax hero establishing landscape as protagonist
2. Stats strip as immediate proof-of-quality signal
3. Philosophy as a "three laws" framework — unusual for food brands
4. Collection as terroir-driven discovery, not e-commerce grid
5. Atelier as the bridge between nature and science
6. Process as vertical timeline — honest, unhurried
7. Heritage quote as emotional peak
8. Press as social proof
9. Allocation form — not "buy now" but "reserve" language
