## Original Elements
- **Brand name "MERIDIAN":** Completely fictional — geographic/navigation metaphor original
- **Hero Type G:** Text-only hero with outline BG letter and live data bar — not seen in any reference
- **Code-comment UI labels:** `// philosophy.md`, `// process_flow.md` etc — original editorial voice
- **"Radical Transparency" as brand pillar:** Publishing reject data as well as winners — unique positioning
- **Roast Analytics Platform:** Fictional in-house software as brand differentiator — original concept
- **7-day rest policy copy:** Original positioning (not just "rest after roasting" but "rest is the final stage of roasting")
- **Press quotes:** All three entirely original
- **Data bar in hero:** Realtime origin data display (lot code, altitude, harvest date) — not seen elsewhere
- **Magnus Voss founder story:** Entirely fictional — chemistry → coffee arc original
