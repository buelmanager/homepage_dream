## What Was Observed (Industry Conventions)

### Shared Patterns Across All 4 References
1. **Section order:** Hero → Product showcase → About/Heritage → Press
2. **Hero treatment:** Watch product prominently featured (bottle-shot equivalent)
3. **Copy tone:** Heritage prestige ("since 1839"), family ownership, generational narrative
4. **Color palettes:** Either cream/white minimalism (Patek, A. Lange) or dark cinematic (Greubel Forsey)
5. **Navigation:** Traditional top navigation, shop/collections primary CTAs
6. **Conversion path:** Product pages → add to cart / request information
7. **Watch presentation:** Flat lay, white background, technical specifications
8. **Credentials:** Awards, certifications, number of references
9. **Typography:** Conservative serifs (Sabon-style) or neutral sans

### Individual Brand Signatures
- **Patek Philippe:** "You never actually own a Patek Philippe" — generational gifting narrative. White, classical, estate photography.
- **A. Lange & Söhne:** Extreme German minimalism, movement photography at center, almost cold precision.
- **F.P. Journe:** Master watchmaker as personality, historical atelier narrative, rustic elegance.
- **Greubel Forsey:** Dark backgrounds, movement complexity as spectacle, science-like approach to complexity.

## What MERIDIAN Chose Not to Copy

| Convention | Our Decision | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Watch shown in hero | **No product in hero** — atmosphere only | Inverts the category expectation; forces emotional engagement first |
| Generational / family narrative | **Singular moment narrative** — one watch per life event | Completely distinct value proposition; no reference does this |
| White/light aesthetic OR pure dark | **Warm midnight: amber-black** | Specific warmth of aged leather/manuscript rather than cold darkness or clinical white |
| Sans serif or Sabon-style serif | **Libre Baskerville + Barlow** | Different font pair from all 4 references; warmer, more humanist serif |
| Shop / collection-first structure | **Commission-first structure** | CTA is always consultation, never purchase — no price shown |
| Awards / certifications prominent | **Declined certification story** | The "Geneva Seal refusal" narrative turns a limitation into a differentiator |
| Product detail pages / specs | **Reference cards with one accord** | Minimal spec disclosure; mystery serves positioning |
| Standard process: gallery → contact | **Philosophy → Complications → Collection → Atelier → Commission → Heritage** | Original order — no reference mirrors this |
| Drag-scroll philosophy cards | **No reference has this section type** | Entirely original section concept |

## Section Structure Comparison

### A. Lange & Söhne (approximate)
Hero → Watchmaking Philosophy → Collection → News/Press → Contact

### MERIDIAN (our structure)
Preloader → Hero (no product) → Philosophy (horizontal drag-scroll, 4 cards) → Complications (stats in watch-face style) → Collection (diagonal offset grid) → Atelier (split image + copy) → Commission Process (5 steps with timeline line) → Heritage (timeline) → Press → Inquiry → Footer

**Differences:** 9 sections vs. ~5. Section order completely different. Unique sections not found in any reference: Philosophy drag-scroll, Complications as stats block, Commission Process with step-by-step conversation narrative.

## Copy Originality

All copy is written from scratch. Key original phrases:
- *"Every Second Was Always Yours"* — no reference uses this line
- *"We Do Not Measure Time. We Sculpt It."* — original concept
- *"Urgency is for instruments of lesser consequence."* — original voice
- *"The Weight of Waiting"* — original philosophy section title
- *"Five Conversations. One Permanent Object."* — original process framing
- *"Against Abundance"* — original philosophy card; inverts industry norm of boasting production scale
- The "Geneva Seal refusal" narrative — fictional but conceptually original anti-credential stance

---

## Why the Final Structure Is Original

1. **Core concept is unique:** "Watches as monuments to singular life events" — no reference positions this way. Patek = generational, A. Lange = precision, F.P. Journe = artisan personality, Greubel Forsey = horological research. MERIDIAN = ceremony.

2. **Section order is original:** The sequence Hero (no product) → Philosophy drag-scroll → Stats → Collection → Atelier → Commission → Heritage → Inquiry exists nowhere in the reference set. Typical order would be: Hero (product) → Collection → About → Press → Contact.

3. **Design decisions invert category norms:** The commission form asks "what moment are you marking?" rather than "which model interests you?" — this question is not asked by any reference site.

4. **Typography combination is fresh:** Libre Baskerville + Barlow has not been used by any reference. The warm amber palette is distinct from the references' white (Patek, A. Lange) or cold dark (Greubel Forsey).

5. **Animation strategy is distinct:** The hero uses floating Roman numerals + depth parallax + SplitText — none of the 4 references use floating typography. The left-side scroll indicator with section names is absent from all references.
