## Concept Originality
- "Private patron cinema" is an entirely novel business concept in this template library

- Film-noir palette (#1a1510, #c9a84c) is unique; closest is watch-atelier (#0d0d0d) — different accent colours
- Filmstrip CSS border pattern appears nowhere in existing templates

## Copy Originality
- All body copy is original: brands, names, addresses, and content are entirely fictitious
- "Édouard Lumière-Beaumont" is a fictitious character
- "Rive Gauche" location is a real Paris area used fictitiously
- Press quotes are fabricated to demonstrate UI; not attributed to real publications
