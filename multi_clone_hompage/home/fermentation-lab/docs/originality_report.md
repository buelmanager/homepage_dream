# Originality Report — KULTIVAT (fermentation-lab)

## References Analyzed
1. QU Fermentation Studio — Michelin collaborations, Asian fermentation, editorial voice
2. Fermenting Studio — minimal studio aesthetic, fermentation as ongoing creative practice
3. Bartosz Ferments — earth-tone packaging, tension between science and handmade

## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Scientific precision | Monospace font code comments (// KULTIVAT_FERMENTATION_RESEARCH v2.12) as aesthetic |
| Artisan fermentation | Batch IDs and strain codes as luxury credentials |
| Japanese fermentation tradition | Kyoto-strain koji as terroir-specific product, not exotic ingredient |
| Long maturation as selling point | Process day-markers (D01, D03, D14, D90) as timeline format |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- Microbial terroir as the core luxury concept (not artisanal technique)
- Code comment aesthetic (// CULT-001) applied to luxury food context
- "When both reach the same conclusion without communication, bottling begins" — two-person blind tasting as quality gate
- Culture strains never shared between clients — exclusivity at biological level
- 14-year continuous mother vinegar culture as living archive
- Commission form with culture type + duration selector — treating fermentation as bespoke research project

## Brand Fiction Note
"KULTIVAT" and all culture strains, batch numbers, and personnel are entirely fictional. No real fermentation studio by this name exists.
