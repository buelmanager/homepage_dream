# Originality Report — PÉTALE Floral Atelier

## Reference Sites Researched
1. Luxury florist sites (researched for UX patterns and positioning — zarla.com/guides/florist-website-examples, muffingroup.com/blog/florist-websites, colorlib.com/wp/florist-websites)
2. High-end botanical brand sites (visual language reference — qodeinteractive.com/magazine/extraordinary-deep-green-websites, 99designs.com/inspiration/websites/luxury)
3. Contemporary floral design studios (interaction patterns — behance.net floral website projects, dribbble.com florist-website tags)

## Key Patterns Observed in References
- Light/pastel color palettes (pinks, creams, soft greens) — standard in luxury floristry
- Horizontal product/arrangement galleries with scroll
- Single-column hero with centered text
- "Order now" / e-commerce focus in most sites
- Simple timeline sections for "About" or "Story"
- Reviews/testimonials near the bottom
- Booking/consultation CTA in a contrasting band

## Inspired Elements
- Cinematic dark botanical aesthetic (uncommon in floristry — borrowed from luxury fashion/fragrance)
- Seasonal collection organization (standard in luxury floristry)
- Commission/bespoke process presentation (common in high-end event floristry)
- Press quote carousel (widely used in luxury brand sites)

## Reimagined / Original Elements
- **Brand name PÉTALE**: entirely original — not based on any real florist brand
- **Tagline "Where Flowers Become Architecture"**: unique positioning angle not seen in references
- **Dark forest green + near-black palette**: none of the researched references used this direction; all used light/neutral or pastel tones
- **"Flowers as architecture" concept**: wholly original framing — most florists use "beauty", "nature", or "romance" positioning
- **Three Laws of Living Beauty philosophy section**: original 3-column grid structure with Roman numeral format; no reference used this pattern
- **Floating botanical SVG silhouettes in hero**: original interaction layer — custom inline SVG paths, not stock elements
- **Season strip (4-column mini-band)**: original — references used full stats sections or skipped entirely
- **Hero 3-layer cinematic with mouse parallax**: references used simple static hero images
- **Process as Roman-numeral accordion**: references used numbered lists or simple text steps
- **Preloader with SVG botanical drawing animation**: stroke-dasharray reveal is an original animated identity element
- **Left-side scroll indicator with fill progress**: no reference site used a fixed lateral section indicator
- **Commission form with "Your Vision" framing**: references used generic booking forms; ours uses editorial language
- **Section copy**: 100% original — all body text, headlines, quotes, and press copy written from scratch

## Why This is Original
- No single reference site's structure is replicated; section ordering is unique
- All copy is written from scratch with an original editorial voice
- The "botanical architecture" concept is a synthesis that no researched site employed
- The dark luxury palette with sage + champagne gold is distinct from all references
- The typography pairing (Cormorant Garamond + Jost) is an original combination for this category
- All brand elements (PÉTALE name, locations, founding story, commissions, team structure) are fictional/original
- The floating SVG botanical layer in the hero is a bespoke interactive element with no direct reference analog
