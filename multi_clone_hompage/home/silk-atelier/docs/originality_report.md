## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Craft heritage (general) | Specific 3-generation family with named individuals and exact dates |
| Material provenance | Single valley, single tributary, 6A thread grade as irreproducible credential |
| Product cards | French names as poetic descriptions ("Le Souffle", "Le Froissement") |
| Bespoke offering | Hidden form — reveals only on click, treating custom order as confidential dialogue |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- Fabric Finder: interactive texture selector teaching silk literacy as seduction
- Bespoke form hidden by default — "begin a conversation" not "fill this form"
- French product names that describe sensation, not product type
- "Three generations trained by the previous, never by software" — punk-luxury positioning
- Punch cards in a cedar cabinet as an anti-digitization statement

## Brand Fiction Note
"Filament & Rêve", the Moreau family, and the Tai Lake sourcing relationship are entirely fictional. No real silk brand by this name exists.
