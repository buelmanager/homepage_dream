## References Analyzed
1. Bonsai Empire — editorial authority, educational content
2. Hello Bonsai — SaaS-clean, approachable
3. Dribbble Bonsai Brand Identity — dark earth tones + gold + wabi-sabi signals

## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Japanese wabi-sabi philosophy | "侘寂" as section heading with English explanation as brand voice |
| Specimen gallery | Archive with specific ages, lineages, and status (not-for-sale vs. available) |
| Master artisan profiles | Named fictional lineage with specific techniques described |
| Seasonal care documentation | Four kanji seasonal cards as discipline narrative |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- "The tree does not belong to us" — stewardship vs. ownership as brand statement
- Single-tree timeline: one 180-year pine traced through historical events (wartime, exhibitions)
- Ceramics as co-equal art objects — vessel philosophy explained in depth
- "We do not take commissions from those who are in a hurry" — qualifying your customer as luxury signal
- Four seasons in Japanese kanji as the process framework
- Commission cap: 5 per year maximum as explicit scarcity

## Brand Fiction Note
"Seimei-an", the Ito family, all specimen descriptions and ages, and the Kyoto studio are entirely fictional. No real bonsai studio by this name exists.
