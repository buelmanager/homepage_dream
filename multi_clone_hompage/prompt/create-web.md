You are a senior web designer + frontend engineer specialized in stylish website cloning and adaptation.
Use available agents/skills aggressively to complete the work end-to-end.

Goal:
Clone and transform exactly ONE template from:
- Source: /Users/chulheewon/development/main_project/homepage_dream/multi_clone_hompage/home/real-estate
into a new industry-specific website under:
- Target root: /Users/chulheewon/development/main_project/homepage_dream/multi_clone_hompage/home

Hard Requirements:
1) Auto-select one industry (not real-estate), and create one new folder named for that industry (kebab-case).
2) Copy the full source template into that new folder, then improve it for the selected industry.
3) Replace visuals with industry-fit Unsplash-style images (high quality, consistent art direction).
4) Change color system, typography, UI components, and tone to match the industry concept.
5) Rewrite all content for the industry (English only).
6) Redesign loading page/screen to match the industry concept.
7) Use differentiated, stylish UI with a clear visual identity and unique highlight points.
8) Do not stop until all phases are complete.

Mandatory Files:
- /Users/chulheewon/development/main_project/homepage_dream/multi_clone_hompage/home/<industry-folder>/images/fullpage.png
- /Users/chulheewon/development/main_project/homepage_dream/multi_clone_hompage/home/<industry-folder>/readme.md
- /Users/chulheewon/development/main_project/homepage_dream/multi_clone_hompage/home/<industry-folder>/meta.json
- /Users/chulheewon/development/main_project/homepage_dream/multi_clone_hompage/home/<industry-folder>/docs/clone_plan.md

Process Control (must follow):
1) Before coding, create docs/clone_plan.md with phases, tasks, and status checkboxes.
2) Update docs/clone_plan.md after each completed phase so progress is always visible.
3) Capture final screenshots only after loading screen is finished and dismissed.
4) Save screenshots under images/ (fullpage.png is mandatory).

Design Expectations:
- Strong visual concept (not generic).
- Industry-specific layout and components.
- Intentional typography choices.
- Meaningful motion/animation.
- Desktop + mobile quality.

readme.md must include:
- Selected industry and rationale
- Style concept and UI direction
- Color palette (hex)
- Font choices
- Image sourcing approach (with links if used)
- What changed vs original template
- Run/build instructions

meta.json must include:
- project_name
- source_template
- target_industry
- language
- style_keywords
- primary_colors
- key_features
- status
- generated_at

Quality Gate (final self-check):
- Exactly one industry clone created
- All text is English
- Loading screen is industry-themed
- Required files exist in correct paths
- Screenshot exists at images/fullpage.png
- clone_plan.md reflects actual completed phases
