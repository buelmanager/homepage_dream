findings:
  trends:
    - point: "Performance as design principle is gaining mainstream adoption in 2026. Designers are now expected to set performance budgets during the design phase — not after handoff — treating page weight as a design constraint equivalent to color or typography."
      source: "https://designingforperformance.com/ (Lara Callender Hogan, O'Reilly); https://cognition.happycog.com/article/designing-with-a-performance-budget"
    - point: "AVIF has emerged as the leading image format for 2026 hero sections, offering 10-30% smaller file sizes than WebP for photographic content, with meaningful impact on large full-bleed hero images loaded over mobile connections."
      source: "https://imagepulser.com/blog/avif-vs-webp-which-wins-in-2026"
    - point: "The recommended 2026 image strategy for homepages is a hybrid approach: WebP as the baseline format for broad compatibility, with AVIF served selectively to compatible browsers via the HTML <picture> element or CDN-level format negotiation."
      source: "https://imagepulser.com/blog/avif-vs-webp-which-wins-in-2026; https://crystallize.com/blog/avif-vs-webp"
    - point: "Skeleton screens have become the default loading pattern for structured content in modern homepages, replacing spinners as the perceived-performance standard for component-based layouts (cards, grids, feature sections)."
      source: "https://ui-deploy.com/blog/skeleton-screens-vs-spinners-optimizing-perceived-performance; https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/skeleton-loading-screen-design/"
    - point: "Video backgrounds in hero sections carry a hidden performance cost: video backgrounds increase Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by approximately 1.2 seconds on average, making them a high-risk design choice without mitigation strategies."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - point: "Typography-focused hero sections have emerged as a performance-first design pattern. Tests show text-only hero sections load 76% faster than image-heavy alternatives while delivering comparable or better conversion rates."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - point: "Only 41% of websites achieve good Core Web Vitals scores on mobile as of current data, revealing a significant industry-wide gap between desktop optimization and mobile performance — a direct consequence of designing desktop-first."

  expert_opinions:
    - who: "Lara Callender Hogan, Engineering Director at Etsy (author of 'Designing for Performance', O'Reilly)"
      opinion: "Performance is user experience — designers bear direct responsibility because their decisions about content, layout, images, and interactivity have an enormous impact on page load time. Performance optimization must be integrated into the design workflow, not treated as a post-launch technical patch."
    - who: "Viget UX Research Team"
      opinion: "Users consistently rate experiences with skeleton screens as 20% faster than identical wait times with traditional loading spinners. The perception gap exists not because the page loads faster, but because the brain interprets visible progress (skeleton layout rendering) as meaningful time passing."
    - who: "GTmetrix / Core Web Vitals guidance"
      opinion: "The LCP element — almost always the hero image or video on a homepage — should never be lazy-loaded. Lazy-loading the hero image is one of the most common and most damaging mistakes designers and developers make, directly undermining the most important Core Web Vitals metric."
      source: "https://gtmetrix.com/dont-lazy-load-lcp-image.html"
    - who: "GoStellar CRO Research"
      opinion: "Each additional 100KB in hero section assets increases bounce rate by 1.8%. This means a designer choosing between a 200KB and 800KB hero image is implicitly making a decision that will raise the site's bounce rate by more than 10 percentage points — a business outcome, not a technical one."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"

  statistics:
    - stat: "When page load time increases from 1 second to 3 seconds, the probability of a bounce increases by 32%. From 1 to 5 seconds: 90% increase. From 1 to 6 seconds: 106% increase."
      source: "Google/SOASTA research, cited in https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
    - stat: "A 2-second delay in page load time increases bounce rates by 103%. If a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load, 53% of mobile visitors will leave."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
    - stat: "Website conversion rates drop by an average of 4.42% for each additional second of load time between 0 and 5 seconds."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
    - stat: "A site that loads in 1 second has an e-commerce conversion rate 2.5x higher than a site that loads in 5 seconds."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
    - stat: "Users form first impressions of a website within 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds). Visual design — not copy, not UX flow — is the only element that registers in that window."
      source: "https://www.identitidesign.com/blog/high-converting-web-design-2025/ (INS-001 source WEB-013)"
    - stat: "Skeleton screens are perceived as 30% faster than spinner-based loading with identical actual wait times. The effect is explained by the psychology of active vs. passive waiting."
      source: "https://ui-deploy.com/blog/skeleton-screens-vs-spinners-optimizing-perceived-performance"
    - stat: "Image compression alone can reduce file sizes by 50-80% while maintaining acceptable visual quality, with WebP/AVIF formats delivering the core of that reduction compared to JPEG/PNG."
      source: "https://searchxpro.com/core-web-vitals-image-delivery-best-practices/"
    - stat: "Vodafone achieved an 8% increase in sales from a 31% improvement in LCP score — a Core Web Vitals metric almost entirely controlled by how the hero image is sized, formatted, and loaded."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
    - stat: "Video backgrounds in hero sections can be optimized by delaying video load until after the page finishes loading. One implementation of this technique reduced initial load time by 42% while maintaining the video experience."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - stat: "Switching from a full-bleed image hero to an abstract gradient background with subtle CSS animation improved LCP by 1.1 seconds while maintaining comparable conversion rates."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - stat: "Implementing WebP as the primary image format for hero sections reduced image weight by 62% while maintaining visual quality in real-world homepage deployments."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - stat: "47% of consumers expect a website to load in under 2 seconds. 79% of users dissatisfied with site performance say they will not return to purchase again."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"

  counterpoints:
    - point: "Performance optimization tools can partially compensate for poor design decisions made upstream. CDNs, server-side image conversion, lazy hydration, and edge caching can recover some load time that would otherwise be lost to heavyweight design choices — which dilutes the argument that designers alone bear responsibility."
      source: "https://skyseodigital.com/core-web-vitals-optimization-complete-guide-for-2026/"
    - point: "The performance-first argument can be taken too far: typography-only heroes or ultra-minimal designs that eliminate all imagery may load faster but can underperform visually rich alternatives in conversion testing. For some product categories (luxury goods, portfolio work, visual media), the conversion benefit of rich imagery outweighs the performance cost."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - point: "Skeleton screens are not a universal performance win. They perform worse than spinners for fast-loading content (under 1 second), long indeterminate processes like file uploads, and video buffering scenarios where a structural preview is meaningless. Overuse of skeleton screens creates a pattern that users stop reading as meaningful."
      source: "https://ui-deploy.com/blog/skeleton-screens-vs-spinners-optimizing-perceived-performance; https://www.nngroup.com/videos/skeleton-screens-vs-progress-bars-vs-spinners/"
    - point: "AVIF adoption introduces workflow complexity that small teams may not be equipped to handle. Unlike WebP, which has near-universal tooling support, AVIF encoding is slower and less consistently supported in design and CMS toolchains — meaning the theoretical performance win may not be realized in practice without infrastructure investment."
      source: "https://imagepulser.com/blog/avif-vs-webp-which-wins-in-2026"
    - point: "The assumption that Core Web Vitals directly drive rankings remains debated. Google has confirmed CWV as a ranking signal, but most SEO practitioners report that content relevance, backlinks, and E-E-A-T signals outweigh page speed in search ranking outcomes for most query types."

  case_studies:
    - title: "Vodafone LCP Optimization Drives 8% Sales Increase"
      summary: "Vodafone improved its Largest Contentful Paint score by 31% through hero image optimization — primarily format conversion, explicit dimension attributes to prevent CLS, and eliminating render-blocking resources above the fold. The direct result was an 8% increase in sales, quantifying the business value of a single Core Web Vitals improvement tied almost entirely to the homepage hero."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
    - title: "GoStellar: Gradient Background Replaces Full-Bleed Hero Image"
      summary: "A homepage A/B test replaced a full-bleed photography hero (large JPEG) with an abstract gradient background and subtle CSS animation. The switch improved LCP by 1.1 seconds. Conversion rates remained comparable, demonstrating that in many contexts, the perceived quality of a visually engaging design can match photography-heavy alternatives at a fraction of the file weight."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - title: "GoStellar: Deferred Video Loading Cuts Initial Load by 42%"
      summary: "A hero section using a background video was redesigned to display a static poster image on initial load, with the video loaded only after the page fully loaded. This approach cut the initial page load time by 42% while preserving the video experience for users who stay on the page — demonstrating that 'showing a video' and 'loading a video on first paint' are two separate design decisions."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - title: "BBC: 10% Visitor Loss Per Additional Second of Load Time"
      summary: "BBC's internal performance research found that for every additional second a page took to load, they lost 10% of their audience. Given that the BBC homepage serves as the entry point to a large content library, this represents a compounding effect: each second of load time delay causes a measurable percentage of users to leave before engaging with any content."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
    - title: "Simplified Content Hierarchy Improves CLS and Conversions Simultaneously"
      summary: "Reducing visual complexity in the hero section content hierarchy — fewer overlapping elements, explicit image dimensions, consistent layout grids — improved CLS scores by 42%. The same change increased conversions by 8%, because a stable layout communicates polish and reliability, whereas layout shifts undermine user trust during the critical first 3 seconds."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - title: "Lara Hogan at Etsy: Making Performance Part of the Design Review"
      summary: "At Etsy, performance metrics were incorporated directly into the design review process — design decisions were evaluated not just on aesthetics but on their projected impact on page weight and load time. This cultural shift meant that a designer proposing a full-bleed video background was required to account for the performance cost in the same conversation as the visual rationale, preventing the typical pattern where performance debt is inherited by developers post-handoff."
