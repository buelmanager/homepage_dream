findings:
  trends:
    - point: "In 2026, hero sections are shifting from novelty-driven design toward structural composition — editorial grids, type-first heroes, asymmetrical layouts, and cinematic framing are replacing safe center-aligned templates."
      source: "https://lexingtonthemes.com/blog/stunning-hero-sections-2026"
    - point: "Text-only and typography-first hero sections are emerging as a distinct pattern for brand-clarity-first scenarios; oversized type paired with minimal content loads 76% faster than image-heavy alternatives."
      source: "https://uxpilot.ai/blogs/web-design-trends-2026"
    - point: "Product preview heroes — showing actual product screenshots or interactive demos — are the dominant pattern for SaaS companies, with tools like Cursor displaying a live code editor and Zoom showing a feature demonstration video."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - point: "Input-capture heroes (e.g., GitHub's email-field-in-hero approach) are trending for platforms where reducing the signup path length is the primary conversion lever."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - point: "The 10-pattern taxonomy now commonly used in UX literature includes: minimalistic, input-capture, split-column, product preview, product showcase, animated, typing-effect, full-size video background, pre/post-hero utility strip, and carousel."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - point: "For SaaS homepages, outcome-specific messaging in the hero (e.g., 'Close deals 30% faster') outperforms vague taglines because visitors arrive with a specific problem in mind, and the hero must immediately address it."

  expert_opinions:
    - who: "LogRocket UX Blog"
      opinion: "Hero sections should be avoided for browse-first digital products (ecommerce, news, forums), dashboard-style interfaces with multiple competing actions, simple task-oriented tools (image converters, chatbots), and for returning users who already know the product."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - who: "Lexington Themes (2026 design analysis)"
      opinion: "The strongest hero sections do not chase trends or timestamps. They rely on layout decisions that age well — grid-based hierarchy and typography doing the heavy lifting instead of decoration or noise."
      source: "https://lexingtonthemes.com/blog/stunning-hero-sections-2026"
    - who: "SplitBase (CRO Agency)"
      opinion: "Attractive hero sections alone do not guarantee conversions. What matters is strategic design grounded in user research and data — analytics analysis, usability studies, and voice-of-customer research should inform hero decisions rather than creative intuition alone."
      source: "https://splitbase.com/blog/hero-section"
    - who: "SplitBase (CRO Agency)"
      opinion: "Brands selling emotional purchases (like Vitaly's jewelry) can succeed with minimal or no headlines in the hero, relying entirely on visual brand communication. Not every hero needs copy."
      source: "https://splitbase.com/blog/hero-section"
    - who: "Prismic (Website Hero Section Guide)"
      opinion: "Too many CTAs in a hero section can significantly impact conversion rates — with some studies showing decreases of up to 266% when multiple competing actions are presented. The single-CTA principle is non-negotiable for hero design."
      source: "https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section"
    - who: "Gostellar CRO Blog"
      opinion: "Optimizing hero sections should be the highest priority testing area on any site — across 500+ A/B tests, hero section optimization produced an average conversion lift of 38%, higher than modifications to any other page element."

    - stat: "Headline copy testing shows that improving copy while maintaining the same design typically yields a 15-25% conversion lift, while improving design with the same copy yields a 10-20% lift — copy has a slight edge."
      source: "https://getshogun.com/learn/landing-page-ab-testing"
    - stat: "A headline tweak in a hero section produced a 27% sales boost in a SplitBase client case study."

      source: "https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section"

  counterpoints:
    - point: "For ecommerce, news, and forum sites, a marketing-focused hero section is often counterproductive — these are browse-first experiences where users arrive to immediately interact with content or products, not to read brand positioning."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - point: "The carousel hero pattern — once ubiquitous — is widely cited as an anti-pattern. Rotating content auto-advances past user intent, fragments attention, and performs consistently worse than a static, focused hero."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - point: "Full-size video background heroes carry a significant performance cost: video backgrounds increase LCP by ~1.2 seconds on average, and each 100KB of additional hero assets increases bounce rate by 1.8% — the visual impact often comes at a conversion cost."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - point: "Returning users and frequent visitors bypass hero sections entirely — investing heavily in a hero section optimized for first-time visitors may actively harm the experience for the segment of users most likely to convert."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - point: "Moving trust badges and social proof signals out of the hero and below the fold paradoxically improved conversion rates by 8% in one CLS-optimized test — hero section 'completeness' is not always a virtue."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
    - point: "Generic or overly abstract stock photos in hero sections add noise and actively reduce trust — a visual that has no direct relationship to the headline or product creates cognitive dissonance."

  case_studies:
    - title: "GitHub — Input-Capture Hero"
      summary: "GitHub integrates an email input field directly into the hero CTA instead of a simple button. This compresses the signup funnel by one step, capturing the most critical data point before the user navigates away. The pattern suits platforms where account creation is the singular conversion goal and friction reduction is the primary lever."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - title: "Cursor — Product Preview Hero"
      summary: "Cursor (AI code editor) uses a live product screenshot showing an actual code editor interface as the primary hero visual. This pattern directly addresses the software buyer's core evaluation question — 'what does this actually look like?' — by showing the product rather than describing it. Product preview heroes are most effective when the UI itself is the differentiator."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - title: "Notion — Benefit-Led Minimalist Hero"
      summary: "Notion's hero headline 'Build something beautiful' is outcome-oriented, not feature-centric. Combined with animated GIFs showing the product in use, it pairs benefit-led messaging with a product preview — demonstrating that minimalism in copy does not mean minimalism in persuasion. Subheading 'get more done with peace of mind' reinforces the outcome angle."
      source: "https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section"
    - title: "Figma — Single-CTA Hero"
      summary: "Figma uses a single high-impact CTA ('Get started for free') with strategic color contrast as the conversion engine of its hero. No secondary CTAs compete for attention. The pattern demonstrates that the most effective hero CTAs are frictionless, singular, and visually dominant — especially for free-tier SaaS products where signup cost is zero."
      source: "https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section"
    - title: "Ahrefs — Social Proof Hero"
      summary: "Ahrefs embeds live social proof directly into its hero section — rotating brand logos and a live metric ('44% of Fortune 500 companies trust Ahrefs') appear as primary content, not footer-tier validation. This pattern suits established B2B tools where credibility with enterprise buyers is the primary conversion barrier."
      source: "https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section"
    - title: "Medium — Minimalistic Hero"
      summary: "Medium's hero uses a three-word heading with a single CTA, stripping away everything that does not serve immediate orientation. As a content-first platform, Medium treats the hero as a transition point — not a conversion surface — directing users to the content as quickly as possible. This is a rare example of a hero section designed to be exited rather than engaged."
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/"
    - title: "SplitBase Client — 27% Sales Lift from Headline Rewrite"
      summary: "A SplitBase client achieved a 27% sales increase by tweaking only the hero headline copy, with no layout or design changes. The test isolated the impact of copy framing from visual design — confirming that messaging optimization in the hero produces measurable revenue impact and should be tested independently of layout decisions."
      source: "https://splitbase.com/blog/hero-section"
    - title: "Gostellar CRO Benchmark — 500+ Hero A/B Tests"
      summary: "Analysis of 500+ A/B tests showed that hero section optimizations produce an average 38% conversion lift — higher than any other page element. The most impactful individual variables tested were: headline framing (benefit vs. product focus), CTA alignment (right vs. center), background weight (gradient vs. high-res image), and trust badge placement (in-hero vs. below-fold)."
