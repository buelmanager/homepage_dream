title: "Why Your Homepage Must Follow Conventions (Cognitive Science Explains It)"
created_at: "2026-02-18T16:00:00+09:00"

hook: "What if the reason your homepage isn't converting has nothing to do with your copy, your colors, or your CTA — and everything to do with where you put your logo? Decades of cognitive science research have converged on one uncomfortable truth: the brain doesn't reward originality on a homepage, it punishes it."

    key_points:
      - point: "Users arrive at your homepage carrying mental models built from thousands of hours on other sites, and every deviation from their expectations costs them cognitive effort they did not budget for."
        evidence: "Jakob Nielsen's foundational principle — Jakob's Law — states that users spend most of their time on other sites, meaning they expect your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Nielsen documented 113 total homepage usability guidelines rooted in this principle. Source: https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/ and https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-ten-guidelines-for-homepage-usability/"
      - point: "Cognitive load is not a metaphor — it is a measurable tax on working memory. When a homepage forces users to re-learn navigation patterns, they spend mental energy on your interface instead of on your value proposition."
        evidence: "The 2026 UX Design Institute principles update reinforces that predictable interfaces eliminate relearning, and that Hick's Law now explicitly justifies a single primary goal per page as a baseline standard, not an advanced optimisation. Source: https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/ux-design-principles-2026/"
      - point: "Cognitive inclusion is becoming a primary design concern in 2026, making cognitive load management more critical than ever as designers now account for ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergent users."
        evidence: "Cognitive inclusion is identified as a key 2026 UX trend, expanding the scope of cognitive load management beyond average users to the full spectrum of human cognition. Source: https://medium.com/@mohitphogat/the-ux-trends-2026-designers-need-to-know-not-just-guess-3269d023b0b7"
      - point: "The Laws of UX framework continues to grow as a scientific vocabulary for designers — the 2025 expansion added Paradox of the Active User, Selective Attention, and Cognitive Bias, confirming that research on convention adherence is accelerating, not settling."
        evidence: "Laws of UX (lawsofux.com) was expanded in 2025 with new principles, affirming that the scientific vocabulary around design conventions continues to grow. Source: https://lawsofux.com/"

    image_keyword: "website navigation structure wireframe"
    key_points:
      - point: "Logo placement is not a creative decision — it is a cognitive one. Left-aligned logos allow users to return to the homepage with only a 4% failure rate, versus measurably higher failure rates for right-aligned logos."
        evidence: "Eye tracking research shows users spend 80% of their time viewing the left half of the page. Only 4% of users had trouble returning to the homepage when logos were left-aligned; right-aligned logos produced measurably more navigation failures in usability tests. Source: https://cieden.com/book/atoms/logo/impact-of-logo-placement-on-ui and https://www.kayakmarketing.com/blog/implications-of-f-pattern-and-z-pattern-layouts-in-website-user-experience-design"
      - point: "Every additional navigation item beyond the Hick's Law threshold adds measurable decision latency. A single specific primary CTA can boost conversions by 161% compared to pages with multiple competing calls to action."
        evidence: "Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices available. Research documents that changing from three CTAs to one primary CTA on a homepage can increase conversion by 161%. A SaaS company saw a 9% sign-up increase after simplifying navigation complexity. Source: https://dovetail.com/ux/hicks-law/ and https://mindfeederllc.com/web-design-and-conversion-rates-2024-2025-insights/"
      - point: "Above-the-fold CTAs receive 304% more clicks than below-the-fold CTAs — a direct consequence of convention-based scanning behavior that places expected decision points in expected locations."
        evidence: "Above-the-fold CTA placement advantage quantified at 304% click-rate differential. Source: https://mindfeederllc.com/web-design-and-conversion-rates-2024-2025-insights/"
      - point: "YouTube's 2017 Material Design rollout is the textbook case of Jakob's Law-compliant redesign: they offered a preview period and reversion option, acknowledging users' existing mental models rather than forcing abrupt cognitive disruption."
        evidence: "YouTube's redesign is cited directly in the Jakob's Law literature as a model for handling major homepage convention changes — allowing users to preview, provide feedback, and revert before full deployment. Source: https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/"
    subsections:
      - heading: "Practical Hick's Law: Progressive Disclosure as the Modern Implementation"
        key_points:
          - point: "Progressive disclosure — showing only essential options at first and revealing complexity on demand — is now the primary Hick's Law strategy for product homepages. It provides depth without cognitive width."
            evidence: "Progressive disclosure is identified in 2025 UX playbooks as the primary Hick's Law implementation strategy for complex product homepages. Source: https://uxcel.com/blog/hicks-law-in-ux-design-simplifying-choices-for-faster-decisions"
          - point: "Mega-menus can outperform simplified menus for high-intent users — Hick's Law governs decision time, not task success rate. Well-grouped richness beats enforced simplicity when users arrive with a specific goal."
            evidence: "Research shows that mega-menus, which appear to violate Hick's Law with dozens of visible links, can outperform simple menus when items are well-grouped and users have high intent. Source: https://dovetail.com/ux/hicks-law/"

  - heading: "Miller's Law: Chunking as the Hidden Architecture of Every Great Homepage"
    image_keyword: "organized grid layout cards interface"
    key_points:
      - point: "Miller's Law is consistently misapplied. The real insight is not 'limit items to seven' — it is chunking: break content into meaningful groups so each group, not each item, occupies one unit of working memory."
        evidence: "Jon Yablonski (Laws of UX, O'Reilly) clarifies: Stripe's checkout groups 'Amount / Promotion Code / Payment Method' in one column and 'Shipping Address / Shipping Method' in another — the user processes two groups, not five fields. Source: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/laws-of-ux/9781492055303/ch04.html"
      - point: "Netflix's content rows are a masterclass in Miller's Law: each category row functions as one working memory chunk regardless of the number of thumbnails it contains, and Netflix limits each row to six visible items."
        evidence: "Netflix limits each visible row to six items. The 'Continue Watching' row is a pure Hick's Law implementation that eliminates browsing decisions for returning users by pre-selecting their most likely action. Source: https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/millers-law-ux-design/"
      - point: "Footer navigation is where Miller's Law and Hick's Law operate simultaneously: grouping 20+ raw links into labeled columns (Company / Product / Resources / Legal) converts them into 4–5 perceived choices instead of 20+ individual decisions."
        evidence: "Chunking footer links into labelled columns applies both Hick's Law (decision reduction) and Miller's Law (working memory grouping). Source: https://lawsofux.com/millers-law/"
      - point: "Modern cognitive science has revised the 7±2 figure downward: working memory capacity for novel information is closer to 4 chunks — meaning the original 'magical number 7' was itself a cognitive convention designers have been over-relying on."
        evidence: "Miller's 7±2 rule is frequently misapplied. The original research measured information channel capacity in bits, not visual items. Modern cognitive scientists argue working memory capacity is closer to 4 chunks for novel information.

    image_keyword: "fast website loading performance speed"
    key_points:
      - point: "The Doherty Threshold's 400ms standard is the floor, not the target. Google's INP metric now defines good responsiveness as 200ms or less — and Amazon's own data shows each 100ms of latency costs 1% in revenue."
        evidence: "Google's Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric, now a Core Web Vital, defines good responsiveness as 200ms or less. Amazon (2006) found each 100ms of latency cost 1% in revenue. Source: https://designzig.com/dohertys-threshold-in-ux-design/"
      - point: "Bounce rate increases by 32% when page load time extends from 1 second to 3 seconds. A 5-second load causes a 90% higher bounce rate than a 1-second load — the Doherty Threshold violation quantified as audience loss."
        evidence: "Bounce rate increases 32% from 1-to-3 second load increase. A 5-second page load causes a 90% higher bounce rate than a 1-second load, with each additional second dropping conversions by approximately 4.4%. Source: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/homepage-design-principles/ and https://mindfeederllc.com/web-design-and-conversion-rates-2024-2025-insights/"
      - point: "Users form an aesthetic opinion of a website in 50 milliseconds — and that first impression almost never reverts. The site rated as more attractive in the first 50ms is subsequently evaluated as more useful, with flaws downplayed and advantages amplified."
        evidence: "Gitte Lindgaard (Carleton University, 2006) established that web users form an aesthetic opinion in as little as 50 milliseconds, and the site rated more attractive in the first 50ms is evaluated as more useful. Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448"
      - point: "94% of first impressions are design-related, and 75% of users judge a company's credibility based on website design alone — making visual polish the dominant factor in initial trust assessment."

    subsections:
      - heading: "Where the Aesthetic-Usability Effect Breaks Down"
        key_points:
          - point: "The Aesthetic-Usability Effect only masks minor usability problems. When core functionality is broken, visual polish amplifies user frustration rather than reducing it — because the attractive design set higher expectations."
            evidence: "Apple's 2025 Liquid Glass redesign generated usability criticism when aesthetic ambition reduced contrast ratios below WCAG AA thresholds — a case where the Aesthetic-Usability Effect was pushed too far and created actual usability regressions. Source: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/ and https://www.index.dev/blog/ui-ux-design-trends"
          - point: "An initially attractive homepage that fails to deliver on its visual promise will produce stronger negative reactions than a plain homepage that simply works — the effect cuts both ways."
            evidence: "The 50-millisecond first impression statistic measures aesthetic judgment, not usability judgment. Users who form a negative first impression can revise it after successful task completion. Source: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-impressions-human-automaticity/"

  - heading: "Convention and Creativity Are Not Opposites: The Stripe, Apple, and Google Proof"
    image_keyword: "creative web design modern minimalist"
    key_points:
      - point: "Stripe's homepage follows every major cognitive law while being visually distinctive. Its structural predictability is precisely what makes its visual innovation feel confident rather than confusing."
        evidence: "Stripe: top-left logo, top-right CTA, five primary navigation items. Miller's Law applied to checkout with two-column grouping (billing vs. shipping). The Aesthetic-Usability Effect leveraged through gradient treatment and animated mesh background creating premium first impression. Source: https://www.perpetualny.com/blog/ux-design-principle-004-millers-law and https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/"
      - point: "Google's homepage is Hick's Law taken to its logical extreme — one primary input, two secondary buttons, and sub-400ms search results — demonstrating that convention-maximalism and global dominance are directly correlated."
        evidence: "Google presents effectively one primary choice (the search box). Google also validates the Doherty Threshold — search results are returned in under 400ms for the vast majority of queries, maintaining the flow state Doherty and Thadani described as 'addicting'. Source: https://dovetail.com/ux/hicks-law/ and https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/"
      - point: "Amazon has become so dominant that it now defines Jakob's Law expectations for all e-commerce: the top-right cart, star-rating display, and product grid layout are mental models that 88% of users will not return if violated."
        evidence: "Amazon's conventions create compounding effects: the larger its user base, the stronger the mental model it establishes, and the higher the cognitive penalty for e-commerce sites that deviate. 88% of users will not return to a website after a poor user experience.

      - point: "Design-by-citation — using cognitive law references to avoid genuine creative problem-solving — is a real failure mode. The laws describe tendencies under average conditions; A/B testing real users on a real homepage is more reliable evidence than citing a principle by name."
        evidence: "Over-reliance on cognitive law justifications can produce 'design by citation' — using research to avoid genuine creative problem-solving. The laws do not predict individual user behavior. Source: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/cognitive-load"
    subsections:
      - heading: "The Practical Lookup Table: Which Cognitive Law Governs Which Homepage Element"
        key_points:
          - point: "Jakob's Law: logo placement (top-left), primary navigation (horizontal top bar), search box (top-right, 27+ characters wide), shopping cart (top-right for e-commerce), CTA button style (filled, high-contrast, rounded)."
            evidence: "NN Group specifies a minimum of 27 characters wide for search boxes so queries are visible as users type. Using a magnifying glass icon for search is a Jakob's Law convention — substituting another icon creates recognition failure. Source: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-ten-guidelines-for-homepage-usability/"
          - point: "Hick's Law: primary navigation items (5–7 max), hero CTAs (one primary), pricing tiers (three is optimal — Free/Pro/Enterprise), footer columns (4–5 labeled groups), feature highlights (3–4 visible, progressive disclosure for the rest)."
            evidence: "Stripe, GitHub, and Notion all use exactly three primary pricing tiers. Research shows every navigation item beyond the Hick threshold adds measurable decision latency. Source: https://dovetail.com/ux/hicks-law/"
          - point: "Miller's Law: navigation dropdown items (7 or fewer per column), feature cards (3, 4, or 6), form field pages (3–5 fields per step), social proof logos (5–8 optimal), testimonials (1–3 at a time in carousel)."
            evidence: "Netflix limits each content category row to 6 visible thumbnails. eBay's homepage item gallery stops at 6 visible images. Source: https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/millers-law-ux-design/"
          - point: "Doherty Threshold: CTA hover and click feedback (under 400ms), navigation dropdown opening (under 400ms), form submission confirmation (under 400ms), search autocomplete suggestions (under 400ms from first keystroke)."
            evidence: "CSS-only dropdowns using :hover are faster than JavaScript-triggered equivalents. For interactions that cannot complete under 400ms, a skeleton screen or progress indicator must appear immediately. Source: https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/"
          - point: "Aesthetic-Usability Effect: hero section production quality (primary lever — 50ms impression window), coherent color palette (inconsistency signals carelessness), typography hierarchy (94% cite as primary trust signal), generous whitespace (premium quality signal)."
            evidence: "The first 50ms of the homepage forms an aesthetic impression that shapes all subsequent usability judgments. Stripe, Linear, and Notion use whitespace as their primary differentiator from competitors with similar functionality. Source: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/"

conclusion:
  summary: "Cognitive science does not restrict homepage creativity — it redirects it. The five laws covered here (Jakob's, Hick's, Miller's, Doherty Threshold, and the Aesthetic-Usability Effect) do not prescribe what your homepage should look like; they prescribe where the structural decisions must be predictable so users can invest their cognitive budget in experiencing your value instead of decoding your navigation. Stripe, Apple, Google, and Netflix are simultaneously the most visually ambitious and the most convention-compliant homepages in the world. Their creativity lives entirely within structural constraints — and that is not a coincidence. The scientific vocabulary in this article is not just useful for justifying design decisions to stakeholders; it is the actual reason the best homepages in the world are built the way they are."
  call_to_action: "Audit your homepage against the five-law lookup table in this article. For each of the 20 elements mapped to a cognitive law, ask one question: does your current implementation align with the convention the law supports, or deviate from it? For every deviation, you need either A/B test evidence that the deviation improves conversion, or a redesign that returns to the convention. If you want a starting point that already embeds these principles structurally, explore homepage templates built with cognitive science constraints as the design brief — then apply your visual creativity on top of a foundation that the research says works."
