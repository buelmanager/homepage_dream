hook: "Across 500+ A/B tests, optimizing the hero section produced an average 38% conversion lift — higher than any other page element. Yet most sites still pick their hero pattern by imitation rather than by intent."

sections:
  - heading: "What Is a Hero Section Actually For?"
    image_keyword: "web design wireframe layout planning"
    key_points:
      - point: "A hero section is not decoration — it is the site's first and fastest argument for why a visitor should stay. Its job is orientation, not impression."
        evidence: "LogRocket UX Blog identifies hero sections as conversion surfaces, not brand showpieces, and warns that browse-first products (ecommerce, news, forums) often perform better without one. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"
      - point: "The ten-pattern taxonomy used in current UX literature covers: minimalistic, input-capture, split-column, product preview, product showcase, animated, typing-effect, full-size video background, pre/post-hero utility strip, and carousel."
        evidence: "This taxonomy is documented across LogRocket and Prismic's hero section research as the standard classification of available patterns. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"
      - point: "In 2026, hero design is shifting from novelty-driven aesthetics toward structural composition: editorial grids, type-first layouts, asymmetrical framing — patterns that age rather than expire."
        evidence: "Lexington Themes 2026 design analysis: 'The strongest hero sections rely on layout decisions that age well — grid-based hierarchy and typography doing the heavy lifting.' (https://lexingtonthemes.com/blog/stunning-hero-sections-2026)"

  - heading: "A Decision Framework: Matching Pattern to Site Type"
    image_keyword: "decision flowchart strategy diagram"
    key_points:
      - point: "SaaS and software products: the product preview hero is the dominant pattern, showing the actual interface as the primary visual. It answers the buyer's core question — 'what does this look like?' — before they scroll."
        evidence: "Cursor (AI code editor) uses a live product screenshot as its hero visual; Zoom shows a feature demonstration video. Both suit scenarios where the UI itself is the competitive differentiator. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"
      - point: "Platforms where account creation is the singular conversion goal: use an input-capture hero. Embedding the email field directly into the hero CTA compresses the signup funnel by one step."
        evidence: "GitHub integrates an email input directly into the hero instead of a simple button, reducing friction at the critical first-action moment. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"
      - point: "Brand-clarity-first scenarios — agencies, editorial brands, and portfolio sites — benefit most from text-only, typography-first heroes, which load 76% faster than image-heavy alternatives."
        evidence: "Oversized type paired with minimal content loads 76% faster than image-heavy alternatives. (https://uxpilot.ai/blogs/web-design-trends-2026 / https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed)"
      - point: "Established B2B tools with enterprise credibility requirements: lead the hero with live social proof — rotating brand logos and real metrics — rather than product visuals."
        evidence: "Ahrefs embeds '44% of Fortune 500 companies trust Ahrefs' directly into its hero as primary content, not footer-tier validation. (https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section)"
    subsections:
      - heading: "When to Remove the Hero Entirely"
        key_points:
          - point: "Ecommerce, news, and forum sites are browse-first experiences: users arrive to interact with products or content, not to absorb brand positioning. A marketing hero delays the task they came to complete."
            evidence: "LogRocket UX Blog explicitly identifies ecommerce, news, and forums as categories where hero sections are counterproductive to the user's primary intent. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"
          - point: "Dashboard-style interfaces, simple task-oriented tools (image converters, chatbots), and returning users who already understand the product are three additional cases where hero sections add friction rather than remove it."
            evidence: "LogRocket UX Blog: returning users bypass hero sections entirely, meaning a hero optimized for first-time visitors may actively harm the experience for users most likely to convert. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"

  - heading: "The Elements That Actually Move Conversion Rates"
    image_keyword: "A/B testing conversion rate analytics dashboard"
    key_points:
      - point: "Copy outperforms layout — and inside copy, benefit-framing outperforms product-framing. Switching from benefit-focused ('Increase Open Rates by 43%') to product-focused copy yielded a 31% lift in sign-ups with no layout changes."
        evidence: "Gostellar CRO benchmark (500+ A/B tests): headline framing was the highest-impact single variable tested. A SplitBase client achieved a 27% sales increase by tweaking only the hero headline, with no design changes. (https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed / https://splitbase.com/blog/hero-section)"
      - point: "A single CTA is non-negotiable. Multiple competing actions in the hero can decrease conversion rates by up to 266% compared to a focused, singular call to action."
        evidence: "Prismic: 'Too many CTAs in a hero section can significantly impact conversion rates — with some studies showing decreases of up to 266% when multiple competing actions are presented.' (https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section)"
      - point: "CTA placement within the hero also matters: right-aligned CTAs increased clicks by 24% and reduced conversion time by 17% compared to centered CTA placement."
        evidence: "Gostellar CRO benchmark on CTA alignment across 500+ hero A/B tests. (https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed)"
      - point: "For SaaS, outcome-specific messaging ('Close deals 30% faster') outperforms vague taglines because visitors arrive with a specific problem and the hero must address it immediately."
        evidence: "Tenet CRO Blog: SaaS homepage visitors carry a specific problem in mind — outcome language matches that mental state in a way feature descriptions cannot. (https://www.wearetenet.com/blog/saas-hero-section-best-practices)"
    subsections:
      - heading: "What the Data Says About Social Proof in the Hero"
        key_points:
          - point: "Counterintuitively, removing trust badges from the hero and moving them below the fold improved Cumulative Layout Shift scores by 42% and increased overall conversion rates by 8%."
            evidence: "Gostellar CRO benchmark: trust badge removal from the hero is one of the most consistently positive changes in CLS-optimized tests. (https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed)"
          - point: "The exception is established B2B brands with high-recognition social proof: in those cases, embedding live metrics (brand logos, customer counts) directly into the hero creates a credibility anchor that benefits conversion."
            evidence: "Ahrefs case study — live enterprise logos displayed in the hero serve as a conversion barrier remover for B2B buyers evaluating credibility before engaging. (https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section)"

  - heading: "The Performance Cost of Hero Pattern Choices"
    image_keyword: "website performance speed loading optimization"
    key_points:
      - point: "Every 100KB of additional hero assets increases bounce rate by 1.8%. Every second of page load delay drops conversion rate by 4.42%. Pattern choices made in a design file have direct revenue consequences."
        evidence: "Gostellar CRO: performance data from 500+ hero optimization tests. (https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed)"
      - point: "Full-size video background heroes — despite their visual impact — increase Largest Contentful Paint by approximately 1.2 seconds on average. Switching from high-resolution product images to gradient backgrounds improved LCP by 1.1 seconds while maintaining conversion rates."
        evidence: "Gostellar CRO benchmark: video backgrounds are the single heaviest performance cost among common hero patterns. (https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed)"
      - point: "Typography-first hero designs load 76% faster than image-heavy alternatives — and the performance advantage compounds with every additional page visit and mobile network condition."
        evidence: "UXPilot 2026 web design trends report and Gostellar CRO benchmark both confirm the 76% load time advantage for text-dominant hero compositions. (https://uxpilot.ai/blogs/web-design-trends-2026)"
    subsections:
      - heading: "The Anti-Pattern: Why Carousel Heroes Persist Despite the Evidence"
        key_points:
          - point: "The carousel hero pattern is widely documented as an anti-pattern. Rotating content auto-advances past user intent, fragments attention, and consistently performs worse than a static, focused hero in A/B tests."
            evidence: "LogRocket UX Blog: carousel heroes are cited as a performance and UX anti-pattern because auto-advance overrides user control and dilutes the singular conversion signal. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"
          - point: "Generic stock photography in hero sections carries a different but equally damaging cost: visuals with no direct relationship to the headline or product create cognitive dissonance that reduces trust rather than building it."
            evidence: "Tenet CRO Blog: 'Generic or overly abstract stock photos in hero sections add noise and actively reduce trust.' (https://www.weareteet.com/blog/saas-hero-section-best-practices)"

  - heading: "Real-World Pattern Decisions: What Leading Products Actually Did and Why"
    image_keyword: "product design case study web homepage examples"
    key_points:
      - point: "Notion's 'Build something beautiful' demonstrates that minimalism in copy does not mean minimalism in persuasion — short, outcome-oriented language paired with animated product demos combines benefit messaging with proof in a single composition."
        evidence: "Notion case study from Prismic: the hero pairs a three-word benefit headline with animated GIFs showing the product in use, balancing copy brevity with visual demonstration. (https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section)"
      - point: "Figma's single high-contrast 'Get started for free' CTA proves that the most effective conversion hero is also the simplest — no secondary CTAs, no competing actions, just one visually dominant entry point."
        evidence: "Figma case study from Prismic: a single CTA with strategic color contrast, no secondary actions. Particularly effective for free-tier SaaS products where signup cost is zero. (https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section)"
      - point: "Medium's three-word hero heading with a single CTA is designed to be exited rather than engaged: the goal is orientation and immediate content access, not conversion in the traditional sense. Some hero sections should minimize dwell time."
        evidence: "Medium case study from LogRocket: as a content-first platform, Medium treats the hero as a transition point that directs users to content as quickly as possible. (https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/hero-section-examples-best-practices/)"
      - point: "The SplitBase principle: attractive hero sections alone do not guarantee conversions. What matters is decisions grounded in user research — analytics, usability studies, and voice-of-customer research — rather than creative intuition alone."
        evidence: "SplitBase CRO Agency: strategic design grounded in user research outperforms aesthetically sophisticated but research-light hero decisions. (https://splitbase.com/blog/hero-section)"

conclusion:
  summary: "The hero section is the highest-leverage element on any homepage — but only when the pattern is chosen to match the site's job, not to match a trend. The right decision framework starts with one question: what is the user here to do? From that answer, pattern selection, copy framing, visual weight, and CTA design all follow. Pattern imitation produces average results. Pattern reasoning produces the 38% lift."
  call_to_action: "Audit your current hero section against the decision framework in this article: identify your site type, your visitor's primary intent, and the single conversion action you want them to take. Then ask whether your current hero pattern — and its performance cost — is actually built for that job."
