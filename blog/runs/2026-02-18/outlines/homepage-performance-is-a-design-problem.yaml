hook: "Your homepage's bounce rate was decided before a single line of code was written — it was decided the moment your designer chose a full-bleed video background, a 2MB hero image, or an auto-playing carousel. Performance is not a technical debt problem. It is a design decision problem."

    key_points:
      - point: "A load time increase from 1 second to 3 seconds raises the probability of a user bouncing by 32%. From 1 to 5 seconds, the increase is 90%. From 1 to 6 seconds, it is 106%."
        evidence: "Google/SOASTA research, cited at sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
      - point: "Conversion rates drop by an average of 4.42% for each additional second of load time between 0 and 5 seconds. A site loading in 1 second has an e-commerce conversion rate 2.5x higher than a site loading in 5 seconds."
        evidence: "sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
      - point: "53% of mobile visitors will leave if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 79% of users dissatisfied with site performance say they will not return to buy from that site again."
        evidence: "sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
      - point: "Vodafone improved its Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score by 31% through hero image optimization alone — format conversion, explicit dimensions to prevent layout shift, and removing render-blocking resources above the fold. The direct outcome was an 8% increase in sales."
        evidence: "Vodafone case study, cited at sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
      - point: "BBC's internal research found that for every additional second of load time, they lost 10% of their audience — a compounding loss given the homepage is the entry point to their entire content library."

    image_keyword: "designer working Figma UI design screen"
    key_points:
      - point: "Performance optimization must be integrated into the design workflow, not treated as a post-launch technical patch. Designers bear direct responsibility because their decisions about content, layout, images, and interactivity have an enormous impact on page load time."
        evidence: "Lara Callender Hogan, Engineering Director at Etsy, author of 'Designing for Performance' (O'Reilly)"
      - point: "Each additional 100KB in hero section assets increases bounce rate by 1.8%. A designer choosing between a 200KB and 800KB hero image is making a business decision that will raise the site's bounce rate by more than 10 percentage points — not a technical decision."
        evidence: "GoStellar CRO Research, gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
      - point: "Only 41% of websites achieve good Core Web Vitals scores on mobile as of current data — a direct consequence of designing desktop-first and treating mobile performance as a secondary optimization concern."
        evidence: "sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"
      - point: "At Etsy, performance metrics were incorporated directly into the design review process. A designer proposing a full-bleed video background was required to account for the performance cost in the same conversation as the visual rationale — preventing performance debt from being inherited by developers post-handoff."

      - heading: "What 'Performance Budget' Means in the Design Phase"
        key_points:
          - point: "Designers are now expected to set performance budgets during the design phase — not after handoff — treating page weight as a design constraint equivalent to color or typography."
            evidence: "designingforperformance.com (Lara Callender Hogan, O'Reilly); cognition.happycog.com/article/designing-with-a-performance-budget"
          - point: "Users form their first impression of a website within 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds). Visual design — not copy, not UX flow — is the only element that registers in that window. This means the design choices that determine first impression are the same ones that determine load performance."

  - heading: "The Hero Section: Where Most Performance Is Won or Lost"
    image_keyword: "hero section website homepage above the fold"
    key_points:
      - point: "The LCP element — almost always the hero image or video on a homepage — should never be lazy-loaded. Lazy-loading the hero is one of the most common and most damaging mistakes designers and developers make, directly undermining the most important Core Web Vitals metric."
        evidence: "GTmetrix / Core Web Vitals guidance, gtmetrix.com/dont-lazy-load-lcp-image.html"
      - point: "Video backgrounds in hero sections increase Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by approximately 1.2 seconds on average, making them a high-risk design choice without explicit mitigation strategies."
        evidence: "gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
      - point: "Image compression alone can reduce file sizes by 50-80% while maintaining acceptable visual quality. WebP delivers the core of that reduction compared to JPEG/PNG, and AVIF delivers a further 10-30% reduction over WebP for photographic content."
        evidence: "searchxpro.com/core-web-vitals-image-delivery-best-practices/; imagepulser.com/blog/avif-vs-webp-which-wins-in-2026"
      - point: "Typography-focused hero sections load 76% faster than image-heavy alternatives while delivering comparable or better conversion rates. Switching from a full-bleed image hero to an abstract gradient background with subtle CSS animation improved LCP by 1.1 seconds with no conversion loss."

      - heading: "Image Format Strategy: WebP, AVIF, and When Each Makes Sense"
        key_points:
          - point: "The recommended 2026 image strategy is a hybrid approach: WebP as the baseline for broad compatibility, with AVIF served selectively to compatible browsers via the HTML picture element or CDN-level format negotiation."

      - heading: "Video Backgrounds: The Deferred Load Solution"
        key_points:
          - point: "A hero section using a background video was redesigned to display a static poster image on initial load, with the video loaded only after the page fully loaded. This cut initial page load time by 42% while preserving the video experience for users who stay on the page."
            evidence: "GoStellar deferred video loading case study, gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
          - point: "The key insight: 'showing a video' and 'loading a video on first paint' are two entirely separate design decisions. Designers who conflate them pay a performance cost they do not need to pay."

  - heading: "Perceived Performance: The Psychology of Loading States"
    image_keyword: "skeleton screen loading placeholder UI"
    key_points:
      - point: "Skeleton screens are perceived as 20-30% faster than spinner-based loading with identical actual wait times. The effect exists because the brain interprets visible progress (skeleton layout rendering) as meaningful time passing — the psychology of active versus passive waiting."
        evidence: "Viget UX Research Team; ui-deploy.com/blog/skeleton-screens-vs-spinners-optimizing-perceived-performance"
      - point: "Skeleton screens have become the default loading pattern for structured content in modern homepages, replacing spinners as the perceived-performance standard for component-based layouts including cards, grids, and feature sections."
        evidence: "ui-deploy.com/blog/skeleton-screens-vs-spinners-optimizing-perceived-performance; blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/skeleton-loading-screen-design/"
      - point: "Reducing visual complexity in the hero section content hierarchy — fewer overlapping elements, explicit image dimensions, consistent layout grids — improved CLS scores by 42% and increased conversions by 8%, because a stable layout communicates polish and reliability during the critical first 3 seconds."

  - heading: "Where the Performance-First Argument Has Limits"
    image_keyword: "luxury product photography ecommerce website"
    key_points:
      - point: "Performance optimization tools can partially compensate for poor design decisions made upstream. CDNs, server-side image conversion, lazy hydration, and edge caching can recover some load time that would otherwise be lost to heavyweight design choices — which means designers are not solely responsible."
        evidence: "skyseodigital.com/core-web-vitals-optimization-complete-guide-for-2026/"
      - point: "For some product categories — luxury goods, portfolio work, visual media — the conversion benefit of rich imagery can outweigh the performance cost. Typography-only or ultra-minimal designs that eliminate all imagery may load faster but can underperform visually rich alternatives in head-to-head conversion testing."
        evidence: "gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"
      - point: "Skeleton screens are not a universal performance win. They perform worse than spinners for fast-loading content under 1 second, long indeterminate processes like file uploads, and video buffering scenarios. Overuse creates a pattern that users stop reading as meaningful."
        evidence: "ui-deploy.com/blog/skeleton-screens-vs-spinners-optimizing-perceived-performance; nngroup.com/videos/skeleton-screens-vs-progress-bars-vs-spinners/"
      - point: "AVIF adoption introduces workflow complexity that small teams may not be equipped to handle. Unlike WebP, which has near-universal tooling support, AVIF encoding is slower and less consistently supported in design and CMS toolchains — meaning the theoretical win may not be realized without infrastructure investment."
        evidence: "imagepulser.com/blog/avif-vs-webp-which-wins-in-2026"
      - point: "The assumption that Core Web Vitals directly drive search rankings remains debated. Most SEO practitioners report that content relevance, backlinks, and E-E-A-T signals outweigh page speed in actual ranking outcomes for most query types."

conclusion:
  summary: "Homepage performance is not a backend problem that gets fixed after launch. It is a series of design decisions — hero image format, file size, video loading strategy, loading state pattern, layout stability — that are made during the design phase and largely locked in by the time developers see them. The good news is that treating performance as a design constraint from the start is not harder than designing without it. It just requires knowing which decisions carry performance weight, setting a budget before you begin, and using the right format and loading patterns for the right scenarios."
  call_to_action: "Before your next homepage design review, add a performance column to your design decision log. For every hero asset choice you make — image format, video usage, animation complexity — note the estimated performance impact alongside the visual rationale. If you cannot estimate it, treat it as a risk to be mitigated before handoff, not after launch."
