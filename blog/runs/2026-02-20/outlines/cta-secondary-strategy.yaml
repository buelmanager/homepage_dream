title: "The Two-Button Homepage: How to Design a Secondary CTA That Converts Without Cannibalizing Your Primary"
created_at: "2026-02-20T15:00:00Z"
hook: "Adding a second button to your homepage hero sounds harmless — but one documented A/B test found that a 'Learn More' secondary CTA increased total clicks by 34% while dropping target conversions by 12%. The difference between a secondary CTA that expands your funnel and one that quietly destroys it comes down to a set of principles most teams skip entirely."

sections:
  - heading: "Why Your Homepage Needs Two Conversion Paths (But Only One Winner)"
    image_keyword: "website button design conversion"
    key_points:
      - point: "Modern homepages serve visitors at fundamentally different stages of purchase readiness — some are ready to commit immediately, others need validation before they will act."
        evidence: "Slack, HubSpot, and Notion all use a two-button hero pattern pairing a transactional primary CTA ('Get started free') with a softer secondary CTA ('Talk to sales' or 'See a demo') to capture both ends of the purchase-readiness spectrum. Source: nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy"
      - point: "The visual hierarchy between primary and secondary CTAs must be unmistakable — the moment both buttons look equally prominent, the secondary CTA begins working against you."
        evidence: "A BMG360 A/B test showed that adding a 'Learn More' button alongside a primary CTA increased total button clicks by 34% but dropped application conversions by 12% and application conversion rate by 10%, because the secondary CTA was not visually subordinated. Source: bmg360.com/blog/post/do-more-choices-mean-more-conversions-a-cta-button-test"
      - point: "Choice Overload (the Paradox of Choice) is the core psychological risk of dual CTAs — two equally prominent options cause decision paralysis, leading visitors to delay action or abandon the page entirely."
        evidence: "GetUplift's psychological analysis of CTA design identifies Choice Overload as the leading cause of failed dual-CTA implementations. The fear of missing out on user segments drives teams to add more CTAs, but fewer, strategically-positioned CTAs outperform competing options. Source: getuplift.co/the-psychology-of-a-cta-button"

  - heading: "The Anatomy of a Properly Subordinated Secondary CTA"
    image_keyword: "ghost button outline UI design"
    key_points:
      - point: "The primary CTA should always use a filled, high-contrast button in brand color; the secondary CTA should use a ghost or outline style that signals availability without competing for the visitor's eye."
        evidence: "DesignCourse (Gary Simon) identifies visual differentiation as the single most critical rule in primary vs. secondary CTA design. Styling both buttons identically destroys hierarchy. Source: designcourse.com/blog/post/primary-vs-secondary-cta-buttons-in-ui-design"
      - point: "Ghost buttons are a statistically viable secondary CTA format, but they must never replace a filled primary button — ghost variants convert at a measurably lower rate in head-to-head tests."
        evidence: "SEEK's comparative research found solid filled buttons achieved 14% conversion while ghost buttons on the same layout achieved 13.1%. A separate ghost button A/B test reached statistical significance with a 20% decrease in clicks on ghost variants vs. solid variants. Source: cxl.com/blog/ghost-buttons"
      - point: "CTA copy consistency matters across the page — using 'Sign up' and 'Get started' interchangeably to mean the same action creates visitor confusion even when visual hierarchy is otherwise correct."
        evidence: "NerdCow (CRO and UX agency) explicitly cautions that 'Sign up' and 'Get started' may seem synonymous but confuse visitors when used interchangeably on the same page. Consistent labeling across the hierarchy is a conversion requirement, not a stylistic preference. Source: nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy"
    subsections:
      - heading: "The Five-Level CTA Hierarchy"
        key_points:
          - point: "Homepage CTAs exist in a five-level hierarchy — in-text links, primary CTAs, secondary CTAs, tertiary CTAs, and scroll-to buttons — and each level must maintain visible differentiation from the levels above and below it."
            evidence: "NerdCow defines this five-level CTA hierarchy and explains that secondary CTAs serve visitors at a different stage of decision-making, using less prominent colors and typically appearing side-by-side with primary buttons. Source: nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy"
          - point: "Secondary CTA buttons should use lighter color with no shadow, ensuring they do not rival the primary for attention even when occupying adjacent space on the page."
            evidence: "VWO Blog (Smriti Chawla) specifies that secondary offers should be less noticeable than the primary, with less heavy color and no shadow as the baseline styling requirement. Source: vwo.com/blog/call-to-action-buttons-ultimate-guide"

  - heading: "Where to Place a Secondary CTA: The Psychological Sequence Map"
    image_keyword: "homepage scroll user journey UX"
    key_points:
      - point: "CTA placement should mirror the visitor's psychological sequence — orientation, evaluation, commitment — with the secondary CTA belonging at the evaluation stage, after benefits or testimonials."
        evidence: "LandingPageFlow's 2026 CTA placement guide states that secondary CTAs belong at the evaluation stage, placed after benefits sections, testimonials, or case study summaries where a visitor has consumed enough information to want a smaller commitment before the final one. Source: landingpageflow.com/post/best-cta-placement-strategies-for-landing-pages"
      - point: "Five strategic CTA placements have emerged as the 2025-2026 homepage standard: (1) hero section for immediate conversion, (2) mid-page after benefits for re-engagement, (3) post-testimonials to leverage trust, (4) end-of-page after the full story, and (5) sticky/floating for mobile continuity."
        evidence: "LandingPageFlow documents these five placements as the current standard for homepage CTA architecture. Source: landingpageflow.com/post/best-cta-placement-strategies-for-landing-pages"
      - point: "Mid-page and below-the-fold CTA placements now reach a meaningfully engaged audience — scroll attention below the fold has grown from 20% of page view time in 2010 to an estimated 60% in 2025."
        evidence: "Above-the-fold attention dropped from 80% in 2010 to 57% in 2018, with 2025 estimates suggesting roughly 40% above-the-fold attention remaining — meaning secondary CTAs placed mid-page are reaching visitors who have already invested time in the page.

      - heading: "Secondary CTAs for Service Businesses: The Lower-Commitment Path"
        key_points:
          - point: "For service businesses, the secondary CTA functions as a trust-building bridge — it offers potential clients a way to stay engaged without requiring the full commitment of a discovery call or purchase."
            evidence: "Pie Heart Studio (Beth, November 2025) describes the secondary CTA as a lower-commitment option for visitors who need more time or context, giving the example of 'Join our mailing list for design inspiration' as a secondary CTA that keeps potential service clients engaged.

  - heading: "Real-World Secondary CTA Strategies: What Slack, HubSpot, and Microsoft Actually Do"
    image_keyword: "SaaS homepage hero dual button"
    key_points:
      - point: "Slack's dual-CTA hero ('Try for free' + 'Talk to sales') succeeds because the two buttons address fundamentally different visitor types — individual self-serve users and enterprise decision-makers who need a human conversation — not because a secondary CTA was added as a hedge."
        evidence: "Slack's homepage pairs a high-saturation primary CTA with a secondary option styled as a less prominent button or text link. Slack also uses device-adaptive CTA copy, changing button text based on the visitor's operating system. Source: nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy and contentsquare.com/guides/web-design/examples"
      - point: "HubSpot's 'Get started free' + 'Get a demo' pattern is a business-model-driven dual CTA — the free trial captures self-directed conversions while the demo request captures higher-value enterprise leads — making the dual-CTA decision a revenue strategy, not a UX preference."
        evidence: "HubSpot uses this consistent dual-CTA pattern across product pages. The two CTAs serve different revenue streams. Source: nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy"
      - point: "Restructuring CTA hierarchy — not just adding a second button — is the actual driver of conversion improvement. NerdCow's restructuring of Courier Exchange's CTA hierarchy doubled inbound leads within one month."
        evidence: "NerdCow's Courier Exchange case study: restructuring CTA hierarchy by demoting secondary actions to ghost buttons or text links, tightening copy, and removing duplicate labeling doubled the number of inbound leads within one month. Source: nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy"
    subsections:
      - heading: "When No Secondary CTA Is the Right Answer"
        key_points:
          - point: "High-intent, single-action scenarios — such as emergency or urgent service businesses — are actively harmed by a secondary CTA. In these contexts, one unambiguous primary action consistently outperforms a dual-CTA layout."
            evidence: "GetUplift's HVAC case study: removing the secondary CTA from the hero section increased phone conversions by 18% and form completions by 45%. Both primary conversion paths improved once the secondary CTA was removed. Source: getuplift.co/the-psychology-of-a-cta-button"
          - point: "A single, well-crafted primary CTA can outperform dual-CTA designs by a wide margin when the page is designed to qualify and funnel visitors toward one clear action — suggesting that a secondary CTA sometimes signals an underperforming value proposition rather than a strategic necessity."
            evidence: "Unbounce's research indicates that reducing CTAs to a single primary CTA increased conversion rates by 266% in one documented test. Source: unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/call-to-action-examples"

  - heading: "How to Decide: A Decision Framework for Adding a Secondary CTA to Your Homepage"
    image_keyword: "decision framework flowchart design"
    key_points:
      - point: "A secondary CTA is justified only when scroll maps, heatmaps, or exit surveys provide evidence that a significant portion of visitors are leaving because they need more information — not because the primary offer is unclear."
        evidence: "Smashing Magazine's foundational design principles caution against adding complexity without a demonstrably better outcome. A secondary CTA adds visual and cognitive complexity and should only be introduced based on behavioral evidence. Source: smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design"
      - point: "Three qualifying questions determine whether a secondary CTA belongs on a given page: (1) Do you serve two distinct visitor types with different conversion paths? (2) Is your sales cycle long enough that some visitors need a trust step before converting? (3) Can you visually subordinate the secondary CTA without any ambiguity?"
        evidence: "Synthesized from NerdCow's five-level CTA hierarchy, GetUplift's psychological CTA analysis, and LandingPageFlow's placement framework. A secondary CTA that fails any of these three tests is likely to reduce primary conversions. Sources: nerdcow.co.uk, getuplift.co, landingpageflow.com"
      - point: "After adding a secondary CTA, measurement must focus on its impact on the primary conversion goal — not just on the volume of secondary CTA clicks. More clicks does not equal better outcomes."
        evidence: "The BMG360 'Learn More' test is the definitive cautionary data point: adding a secondary CTA increased total engagement but caused a net decline in target conversions. Teams must track the primary conversion rate before and after introducing a secondary CTA. Source: bmg360.com/blog/post/do-more-choices-mean-more-conversions-a-cta-button-test"

conclusion:
  summary: "A secondary CTA is not a safety net — it is a precision tool for serving a distinct visitor segment that your primary CTA cannot reach. Used correctly, with clear visual subordination, segment-specific copy, and placement timed to the visitor's evaluation stage, it expands your conversion funnel without competing with your primary action. Used carelessly, it introduces exactly the kind of choice paralysis that sends qualified visitors away. The evidence from Slack, HubSpot, and Courier Exchange confirms the upside; the HVAC study and BMG360 test quantify the cost of getting it wrong."
  call_to_action: "Run a 30-minute homepage audit before your next CTA decision: open a heatmap or scroll map of your current homepage, identify where visitors disengage, and ask whether they are leaving because the primary offer is unclear or because they need a lower-commitment next step. That answer determines whether a secondary CTA will help or hurt."
