hook: "The HubSpot red button test is cited everywhere as proof that color drives clicks — but researchers now believe the result had nothing to do with the color itself. If the most famous color psychology case study in web history may have measured contrast all along, it is worth asking which homepage color rules are genuinely evidence-based and which ones you have been following on faith."

        key_points:
          - point: "Allocate 60% of the design to a dominant color, 30% to a secondary color, and 10% to an accent color. This prevents visual chaos and ensures accent colors — typically CTAs — draw the eye effectively."

        key_points:
          - point: "Step 1 — Meet the floor: verify all text and UI elements pass WCAG AA contrast ratios using a free tool such as WebAIM's Contrast Checker before any aesthetic work begins."
            evidence: "WebAIM contrast-first methodology. (https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/)"
          - point: "Step 2 — Know your audience: research the cultural context, age demographic, and gender distribution of your primary user group before selecting a palette, since these variables significantly moderate color response."
            evidence: "Toptal Design Experts on moderating variables in color psychology. (https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/color-psychology)"
          - point: "Step 3 — Apply the 60-30-10 rule: assign dominant, secondary, and accent colors to your layout, reserving the accent for CTAs and key conversion elements to maximize visual hierarchy."
            evidence: "Shakuro 60-30-10 implementation guidance. (https://shakuro.com/blog/how-color-impacts-user-behavior-and-boosts-website-conversion)"
          - point: "Step 4 — Validate with segment-level A/B testing: document baseline metrics, test on high-intent pages first, and segment results by device and user type before drawing conclusions."
            evidence: "Clickguard A/B testing by segment framework. (https://www.clickguard.com/blog/call-to-action-colors-for-landing-pages/)"

conclusion:
  summary: "Color is not a magic lever that produces predictable emotional or behavioral responses on demand. It is a design element whose impact depends on contrast ratios, cultural context, audience demographics, and consistency over time. The most effective homepage color strategy starts with accessibility compliance as a non-negotiable floor, uses contrast as the primary mechanism for directing attention, applies the 60-30-10 rule for structural balance, and validates assumptions with A/B testing rather than universal color psychology charts. Evidence-backed decisions will always outperform borrowed rules."
  call_to_action: "Run your homepage through WebAIM's free Contrast Checker today. If any text or UI element fails the 4.5:1 AA standard, that is the single highest-ROI color fix you can make — and it will improve your results before you change a single hue."
