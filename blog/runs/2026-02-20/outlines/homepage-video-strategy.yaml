hook: "A well-executed homepage hero video can lift conversion rates by up to 86%—but the same design decision, applied to the wrong page, can quietly tank your Core Web Vitals, alienate mobile users, and bury the very message you want visitors to read. The question is never whether video is powerful; it is whether video is right for your homepage and whether you have the technical discipline to deploy it properly."

        evidence: "HubSpot Marketing Statistics 2025 (https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics)"
      - point: "Video on homepages has matured beyond decoration: 2026 implementations use it for founder messaging, product-in-action demos, behind-the-scenes storytelling, and quick explainers—not just ambient atmosphere."

      - point: "The conversion uplift is conditional: video directly supports conversion goals only when it is paired with clear CTAs, strong copy, and thoughtful scroll behavior—video that distracts from the primary offer cancels out any benefit."

        key_points:
          - point: "Hospitality brands (restaurants, event venues, hotels, luxury goods) gain the most from short-form hero video because they are selling atmosphere and sensory experience that static images cannot fully communicate."

    key_points:
      - point: "File size discipline is the single most critical constraint: keep embedded video at 500KB ideally and 1-2MB maximum, with 3-7 seconds of looping content. Beyond this threshold, load times measurably degrade on 4G networks."

        key_points:
          - point: "LCP measures the video poster image and first-frame display time—not playback—meaning teams who optimize video compression while neglecting the poster image are solving the wrong problem."

            evidence: "Google Web.dev LCP Optimization Guide 2025"
          - point: "Never lazy-load the LCP video element. Serve the poster image in WebP or AVIF format with the fetchpriority='high' attribute. CSS background-image approaches create invisible preload delays because browsers cannot discover unencountered CSS—use an img element or explicit preload directive instead."

        evidence: "Shopify Homepage Design guide (https://www.shopify.com/blog/homepage-design)"
      - point: "30% of users on metered mobile connections have video autoplay disabled or hidden, making a static fallback image essential rather than optional—mobile users experience bandwidth constraints, battery drain, and inability to pause."

      - point: "Device-aware video delivery is the 2026 standard: hide video on screens below 768px width via CSS media queries and display an optimized JPEG or WebP instead. Alternatively serve a lower-bitrate MP4 to smaller devices."

      - point: "Accessibility requirements for video backgrounds are now design-first considerations, not post-launch audits. Include visible play/pause controls, implement the prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable autoplay, and provide captions or aria-labels describing video content."
        evidence: "Webflow blog on website background video (https://webflow.com/blog/website-background-video-tips-tricks-and-resources)"
      - point: "Use native video elements rather than animated GIFs. GIFs are 3-10x larger in file size than compressed MP4 and lack native accessibility controls—video with native playback is the professional standard for both performance and inclusivity."
        evidence: "Cloud Four blog on accessible animated GIF alternatives (https://cloudfour.com/thinks/accessible-animated-gif-alternatives/)"
      - point: "Avoid blinking and flashing patterns that exceed three flashes per second. Users with vestibular disorders and motion sensitivity represent a measurable segment of visitors, and ignoring them introduces legal risk alongside UX failure."

        key_points:
          - point: "The correct implementation serves two user groups simultaneously: visitors who want the full animated experience get autoplaying video, while visitors with motion sensitivity preferences receive the optimized poster image as a static hero. One CSS media query handles both."

        evidence: "WordStream 2026 Conversion Rate Optimization Research"
      - point: "The five questions to answer before adding homepage video: (1) Are you selling atmosphere or logic? (2) Is your primary audience on mobile? (3) Do you have custom footage or only stock video? (4) Can you maintain the video asset over time? (5) Will you hit the 500KB file size target?"

      - heading: "The Stock Video Trap"
        key_points:
          - point: "Generic stock video undermines the core value proposition of video on a homepage: differentiation through authentic brand atmosphere. A stock beach video on a luxury spa homepage communicates the same inauthenticity as a stock photo, with four times the performance cost."

conclusion:
  summary: "Homepage video is not a design trend to adopt or reject wholesale—it is a strategic tool with a narrow set of conditions under which it performs significantly better than a static alternative. Hospitality, events, luxury goods, and atmosphere-first brands gain the most. B2B, SaaS, and complex-offer pages gain the least and often lose ground. When video is the right choice, the technical execution must be disciplined: 500KB file sizes, LCP-optimized poster images, mobile fallbacks below 768px, and accessibility-first autoplay controls. The brands that win with homepage video are those who treat it as a performance and UX engineering problem first, and a creative decision second."
  call_to_action: "Run a PageSpeed Insights audit on your current homepage, note your LCP score, then ask the five questions above. If video clears all five filters, start with a compressed 5-second loop at under 500KB—measure the LCP delta before publishing. If it does not clear the filters, invest that production budget in a high-quality custom poster image and a sharper hero headline instead."
