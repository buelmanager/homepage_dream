title: "5 Modern CSS Features That Transform Homepage Design Without a Single Line of JavaScript"
created_at: "2026-02-20T15:00:00Z"
hook: "Despite being broadly available across all major browsers since 2023, only 41% of developers have ever used CSS container queries — meaning a majority of homepages are still solving problems with JavaScript that CSS now handles natively. Here are five CSS features that replace entire categories of JS dependency and make homepage designs measurably better."

sections:
  - heading: "Container Queries: The End of Viewport-Only Responsive Design"
    image_keyword: "responsive web design grid layout"
    key_points:
      - point: "Container queries let components adapt based on their parent container's width, not the viewport — enabling truly reusable, layout-agnostic components."
        evidence: "Container queries have reached production readiness with baseline browser support since 2023 and 90%+ U.S. traffic coverage by late 2025, eliminating the need for JavaScript resize listeners. (https://caisy.io/blog/css-container-queries)"
      - point: "The canonical homepage use case is the card component: the same card renders correctly in a full-width hero, a 3-column grid, and a narrow sidebar — with zero media queries."
        evidence: "Case study from LogRocket: .card-wrapper { container-type: inline-size; } @container (min-width: 500px) { .card { display: flex; flex-direction: row; } } — one rule set handles all layout contexts. (https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/)"
      - point: "CSS style queries extend the concept to component theme variants: different density modes or color themes can be driven by CSS custom properties on the container instead of JavaScript class toggling."
        evidence: "Kevin Powell's 'Style Query Spotlight' series (June 2025) argues that style queries are changing the fundamental way CSS is written, enabling theme variants and density modes through custom properties. (https://frontendmasters.com/tutorials/kevin-powell/style-queries/)"
    subsections:
      - heading: "Container Queries vs. Media Queries: A Complementary Pair, Not Competitors"
        key_points:
          - point: "Container queries cannot and should not replace media queries for viewport-level decisions such as print styles, device orientation, prefers-color-scheme, and prefers-reduced-motion."
            evidence: "Viewport-level layout decisions still require traditional media queries. Overuse of container queries can introduce performance penalties due to containment recalculation overhead. (https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/)"
          - point: "A key constraint to plan for: elements cannot query themselves — only children of a container can respond to a container query, which requires an extra wrapper element in the HTML."
            evidence: "This containment hierarchy constraint requires teams to add extra wrapper elements, which can clash with existing semantic HTML structure and complicate markup. (https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/)"

  - heading: "Scroll-State Queries: JavaScript-Free Sticky Navigation"
    image_keyword: "website navigation sticky header scroll"
    key_points:
      - point: "Container scroll-state queries allow a sticky navigation bar to detect its own 'stuck' state and update its background, blur, and padding without any JavaScript scroll listeners."
        evidence: "Using @container (scroll-state(stuck: top)), the classic 'shrinking nav on scroll' pattern — background color, backdrop-filter blur, reduced padding — works with zero JavaScript in Chrome and Edge. (https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/)"
      - point: "The adoption gap here is extreme: fewer than 1% of developers have adopted scroll-state queries, making early implementation a genuine competitive differentiator."
        evidence: "The 2025 State of CSS survey found fewer than 1% of developers have adopted scroll-state queries, despite the feature being available in Chrome, Edge, and Opera. (https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/)"
    subsections:
      - heading: "Progressive Enhancement Strategy for Scroll-State Queries"
        key_points:
          - point: "Scroll-state queries currently work only in Chrome, Edge, and Opera — teams targeting Firefox and Safari must treat this as a progressive enhancement with a static fallback."
            evidence: "Container scroll-state queries (Chrome/Edge/Opera only as of early 2026) lack support in Firefox and Safari, requiring fallback styles for non-supporting browsers. (https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/)"

  - heading: "The :has() Selector and text-wrap: balance — Two Small Properties With Big Impact"
    image_keyword: "CSS typography headline web design"
    key_points:
      - point: "The :has() pseudo-class reverses CSS selector logic, letting parent elements react to their children's state — enabling JavaScript-free dark mode toggles, modal scroll locks, and conditional navigation sub-menus."
        evidence: "A full dark/light mode toggle can be built with html:has(#dark-toggle:checked) { color-scheme: dark; --bg: #1a1a1a; } — no JavaScript event listener or classList.toggle() required. (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/12/new-front-end-features-for-designers-in-2025/)"
      - point: "text-wrap: balance automatically distributes headline words equally across lines, eliminating awkward single-word orphans on hero headings without manual line breaks or JavaScript resize observers."
        evidence: "For a headline like 'Craft Coffee Roasted With Intention in Brooklyn', the browser automatically distributes words across balanced lines regardless of viewport width — replacing a previously JavaScript-dependent effect. (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/12/new-front-end-features-for-designers-in-2025/)"
      - point: "text-wrap: balance is purposefully limited to 6 lines (Chromium) or 10 lines (Firefox), making it optimized for above-the-fold hero headlines and card titles rather than body copy."
        evidence: "The line cap exists for performance reasons; this makes the property purpose-built for homepage hero elements. Minor layout shifts on initial render can affect CLS scores. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap)"

  - heading: "OKLCH: A Richer, More Predictable Color System for Homepage Palettes"
    image_keyword: "color palette design system brand"
    key_points:
      - point: "OKLCH is the first CSS color model that is both perceptually uniform and human-readable — adjusting lightness does not shift perceived saturation the way HSL does, making predictable accessible color scales far easier to generate."
        evidence: "Evil Martians engineering team: OKLCH makes generating accessible color scales (AA/AAA contrast ratios) far more predictable and reduces manual color correction effort. (https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl)"
      - point: "OKLCH unlocks approximately 50% more displayable colors than sRGB by leveraging the Display P3 gamut available on modern screens, enabling richer homepage brand palettes."
        evidence: "OKLCH global browser support exceeded 92% in Q2 2025 across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. It unlocks ~50% more colors than sRGB via Display P3. (https://medium.com/@alexdev82/oklch-the-modern-css-color-space-you-should-be-using-in-2025-52dd1a4aa9d0)"
      - point: "Design teams like those at Stripe and Linear have adopted perceptually uniform color spaces to generate a complete tonal scale (50–950) where every step has a consistent perceived lightness jump and automatic WCAG AA compliance."
        evidence: "OKLCH enables generating a complete tonal scale where each step has genuinely consistent perceived lightness, producing accessible contrast ratios predictably without manual spot-checking. (https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl)"
    subsections:
      - heading: "When OKLCH Is Not Worth the Effort"
        key_points:
          - point: "For simple websites with a small, fixed color palette, OKLCH migration complexity may not justify the investment — especially since Figma does not export OKLCH values natively as of early 2026."
            evidence: "Developer familiarity with RGB/HEX remains much higher industry-wide, and design tools do not yet export OKLCH values natively, requiring manual conversion in CSS. (https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl)"

  - heading: "The Native dialog Element: Accessible Modals Without the JavaScript Overhead"
    image_keyword: "modal popup web design UX"
    key_points:
      - point: "The native HTML dialog element provides built-in Esc key close, focus trapping, and a ::backdrop pseudo-element for overlay styling — replacing heavy third-party modal libraries with minimal JavaScript (dialog.showModal() / dialog.close())."
        evidence: "Replacing a JS-library-dependent lead capture modal with the native dialog element eliminates 3-5 accessibility bugs common in custom modal implementations, including broken focus trapping and missing keyboard dismissal. (https://michael-fares.medium.com/easily-create-modals-in-2025-with-the-native-html-dialog-element-and-no-external-dependencies-881e03fa195c)"
      - point: "The ::backdrop pseudo-element provides a native animation hook for fade-in overlay effects, and the overall approach reduces modal implementation to HTML structure plus two lines of JavaScript."
        evidence: "Built-in Esc key handling, focus trapping, and ::backdrop overlay eliminate the most common modal accessibility failures. The ::backdrop pseudo-element provides a native animation hook for overlay effects. (https://michael-fares.medium.com/easily-create-modals-in-2025-with-the-native-html-dialog-element-and-no-external-dependencies-881e03fa195c)"
      - point: "Teams needing highly animated or deeply customized modal designs may still prefer a lightweight JS-driven solution — the native dialog's styling flexibility has documented edge cases across browsers."
        evidence: "The ::backdrop pseudo-element and animation support have edge cases across browsers. Teams needing highly animated or deeply customized modal designs may still prefer a lightweight JS-driven solution. (https://css-tricks.com/getting-creative-with-html-dialog/)"

conclusion:
  summary: "Five native CSS features — container queries, scroll-state queries, :has(), text-wrap: balance, OKLCH, and the native dialog element — are broadly available today and collectively eliminate the most common categories of JavaScript dependency in homepage design. The adoption gap is significant: only 41% of developers have used container queries at all, meaning teams that implement even two or three of these features gain a measurable technical and design advantage over the majority of the web."
  call_to_action: "Pick one feature from this article and apply it to a single homepage component this week. Start with text-wrap: balance on your hero headline — it requires one line of CSS, works in all modern browsers, and produces a visible improvement in typography quality immediately. Then audit your sticky navigation and card components for container query opportunities."
