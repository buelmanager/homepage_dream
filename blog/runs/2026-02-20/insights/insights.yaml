    title: "The 15-Second Rule: Why Clarity Beats Creativity on Your Homepage Hero"
    summary: >
      Multiple authoritative sources converge on a single behavioral fact: visitors decide
      whether to stay or leave within 15 seconds of landing on a homepage. This insight
      synthesizes NN/g's research-backed principles, HubSpot's conversion checklist, and
      Shopify's real-world brand examples to make the case that value clarity — not visual
      novelty — is the highest-ROI investment any homepage can make. It is valuable as a
      blog post because it directly challenges the common assumption that a striking hero
      design is the primary goal, replacing it with a testable, actionable framework.

    title: "CTAs That Actually Convert: The Science Behind Homepage Button Design"
    summary: >
      Converging guidance from HubSpot, Shopify, and Contentsquare — anchored in behavioral
      analytics data — reveals a precise set of CTA design rules that consistently improve
      conversion: five words or fewer on buttons, 2-3 CTAs above the fold, high color
      contrast, and adaptive copy per device context. Slack's documented practice of
      customizing CTA text per operating system (WEB-012) is a particularly compelling
      data point that elevates this beyond generic advice. This topic is blog-worthy because
      CTA optimization is universally applicable yet rarely implemented with this level of rigor.

    title: "Functional Motion Design: How to Use Animation Without Losing Users"
    summary: >
      Four separate trend sources from 2025 and 2026 (Elementor, Organica, Webstacks, Framer)
      consistently identify a shift from decorative animation to functional motion design —
      animations that guide users, confirm actions, and tell stories rather than simply
      attract attention. This is paired with accessibility-first animation principles
      (prefers-reduced-motion) from Framer's source. The topic is valuable because most
      teams either overuse animation decoratively or avoid it entirely, and this post can
      offer a clear middle path grounded in both design craft and UX research.

    title: "Ditch the Stock Photo: Why Visual Authenticity Is a Conversion Driver"
    summary: >
      Three independent sources — NN/g, Smashing Magazine, and Shopify — arrive at the
      same conclusion through different evidence paths: generic stock photography actively
      damages credibility, while specific, real, or custom visuals improve trust and conversion.
      Smashing Magazine's global design roundup adds the dimension that international design
      traditions (Japanese, European) demonstrate how visual authenticity can take many forms
      beyond literal photography. This is a highly actionable blog post because most small
      businesses default to stock photos and the alternative paths (custom illustration,
      lifestyle photography, brand-specific imagery) are concrete and attainable.

    title: "Modern CSS Superpowers: What Container Queries and OKLCH Mean for Homepage Design"
    summary: >
      Smashing Magazine's 2025 front-end features overview (WEB-003) introduces a set of
      native browser capabilities — container queries, the :has() selector, text-wrap
      balance, OKLCH color spaces, and the native dialog element — that collectively
      eliminate entire categories of JavaScript dependency and design compromise. This
      insight is valuable as a blog post because these features remain under-adopted
      despite being broadly available, and homepage builders stand to gain immediately
      practical wins in responsive layout, typography polish, color richness, and
      accessible modals. The post can bridge the gap between developer and designer audiences.

    title: "Performance Is Design: Why Page Speed Is the Most Important UX Decision You Make"
    summary: >
      Two trend sources from 2026 — Organica Agency and Shopify — independently frame
      performance not as an engineering metric but as a core design discipline. Organica
      states directly that a slow website loses clients regardless of visual quality, while
      Shopify emphasizes that over 60% of web traffic is mobile, meaning performance
      failures disproportionately impact the majority of visitors. Combined with Smashing
      Magazine's endorsement of native browser features that reduce JavaScript dependency,
      this insight makes a compelling case that the best homepage designers are also
      performance advocates. This topic bridges design and development audiences effectively.

    title: "The Homepage as a Business Tool: Embedding Booking, Quotes, and Configurators"
    summary: >
      Both Elementor (WEB-006) and Organica Agency (WEB-007) identify the same 2026 macro
      trend: homepages are evolving from static digital brochures into operational business
      instruments with embedded booking calendars, quote generators, and service configurators.
      This shift fundamentally changes homepage design priorities — the hero section must
      now drive toward an immediate interactive action rather than simply communicating brand
      identity. For local businesses (restaurants, salons, gyms, tour operators), this
      represents a concrete, implementable strategy that most competitors have not yet adopted,
      making it an immediately actionable blog post topic.

    title: "Breaking the Template: When and How to Use Asymmetric, Organic Homepage Layouts"
    summary: >
      Three trend sources for 2025-2026 (Elementor, Webstacks, Framer) converge on the
      rejection of rigid grid uniformity in favor of organic shapes, asymmetric compositions,
      and dynamic layouts — while the foundational sources (NN/g, Smashing Magazine) caution
      against abandoning conventions without demonstrably better alternatives. This tension
      between innovation and convention is the core editorial value of this insight: a blog
      post that synthesizes both perspectives gives readers a decision framework rather than
      a blanket trend endorsement. The topic is timely and differentiated from generic
      trend reporting.

    summary: >
      HubSpot (WEB-011), Shopify (WEB-010), and Contentsquare (WEB-012) all identify
      social proof as a non-negotiable homepage element, but each source adds a distinct
      layer of nuance: HubSpot specifies that testimonials require real names and specific
      outcomes to be credible; Shopify shows how lifestyle photography implicitly embeds
      social proof through aspirational framing; Contentsquare's analytics-grounded
      examples demonstrate that minimal friction (fewer steps to conversion) amplifies
      trust signals. The synthesis produces a comprehensive trust architecture framework
