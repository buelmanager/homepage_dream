  trends:
    - point: "Visitor scroll depth below the fold has grown significantly — Nielsen Norman Group data shows users spent 80% of their time above the fold in 2010, dropping to 57% in 2018, with estimates suggesting as little as 40% above-the-fold attention by 2025. This shifts the secondary CTA from an afterthought to a strategic mid-page tool."
      source: "https://cxl.com/blog/above-the-fold/ via LandingPageFlow summary"

    - point: "The 2026 trend among SaaS homepages is pairing a transactional primary CTA (e.g., 'Get started free') with a softer secondary CTA (e.g., 'Talk to sales' or 'See a demo') to capture visitors at both ends of the purchase-readiness spectrum. HubSpot, Slack, and Notion all use this two-button hero pattern."
      source: "https://nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy/"

    - point: "Secondary CTAs are increasingly designed as plain text links or ghost buttons rather than filled buttons, creating a clear visual hierarchy that separates the commitment level of each action. This is now considered a standard UX pattern for SaaS and service businesses."
      source: "https://designcourse.com/blog/post/primary-vs-secondary-cta-buttons-in-ui-design"

    - point: "Five high-converting CTA placements have emerged as the 2025-2026 standard for homepage architecture: (1) hero section for immediate conversion, (2) mid-page after benefits for re-engagement, (3) post-testimonials to leverage trust, (4) end-of-page after full story, and (5) sticky/floating for mobile continuity."

  expert_opinions:
    - who: "NerdCow (CRO and UX agency)"
      opinion: "CTA hierarchy has five distinct levels: in-text links, primary CTAs, secondary CTAs, tertiary CTAs, and scroll-to buttons. Secondary CTAs serve visitors at a different stage of decision-making — they use less prominent colors and are typically paired side-by-side with primary buttons. Consistency in labeling matters: 'Sign up' and 'Get started' may seem synonymous but can confuse visitors if used interchangeably on the same page."

    - who: "GetUplift (conversion psychology specialists)"
      opinion: "Adding a secondary CTA to reduce choice friction is often counterproductive. Their HVAC case study found that removing a secondary CTA increased phone conversions by 18% and form completions by 45%. The underlying psychology is Choice Overload — too many options cause decision paralysis. Fear of missing out on user segments drives teams to add more CTAs, but fewer, strategically-positioned CTAs actually outperform multiple competing options."

    - who: "DesignCourse (Gary Simon)"
      opinion: "The single most critical rule in primary vs secondary CTA design is visual differentiation. Styling both buttons identically destroys the hierarchy. The primary CTA should be a filled, high-contrast button in brand color; the secondary CTA should use a ghost or outline style that is available to users who need an alternative but clearly subordinate to the main action."

    - who: "Pie Heart Studio (Beth, published November 2025)"
      opinion: "A secondary CTA is a lower-commitment option for visitors who need more time or context before they are ready to work with you. For service businesses, a secondary CTA such as 'Join our mailing list for design inspiration' keeps potential clients engaged without requiring the full commitment of a discovery call."

    - who: "LandingPageFlow (2026 CTA placement guide)"
      opinion: "Conversion follows a psychological sequence — orientation, evaluation, commitment — and CTA placement should mirror this arc. Secondary CTAs belong at the evaluation stage: placed after benefits sections, testimonials, or case study summaries, where a visitor has consumed enough information to want a smaller commitment before the final one."
      source: "https://www.landingpageflow.com/post/best-cta-placement-strategies-for-landing-pages"

    - who: "VWO Blog (Smriti Chawla)"
      opinion: "Secondary offers should be less noticeable or appealing compared to the primary offer. The secondary CTA button should use less heavy color with no shadow, ensuring it does not rival the primary for attention even if it occupies similar space on the page."

  statistics:
    - stat: "Reducing the number of CTAs on a page to a single primary CTA increased conversion rates by 266% in one documented test, highlighting the cost of CTA competition when secondary actions are not properly subordinated."
      source: "https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/call-to-action-examples/ (referenced via multiple CRO sources)"

    - stat: "An A/B test by BMG360 found that adding a 'Learn More' button alongside a primary CTA increased total button clicks by 34%, but application conversions dropped by 12% and application conversion rate declined by 10% — demonstrating that a secondary CTA can cannibalize primary conversions if not visually subordinated."
      source: "https://www.bmg360.com/blog/post/do-more-choices-mean-more-conversions-a-cta-button-test"

    - stat: "SEEK's comparative research on button styles found that solid filled buttons achieved 14% conversion while ghost buttons on the same layout achieved 13.1% — a modest difference that confirms ghost buttons are viable secondary CTAs but should never replace filled primary buttons."
      source: "https://cxl.com/blog/ghost-buttons/"

    - stat: "One ghost button A/B test reached statistical significance with a 20% decrease in clicks on ghost button variants compared to solid button variants, reinforcing the rule that ghost buttons should only be used for intentionally de-emphasized secondary actions."
      source: "https://cxl.com/blog/ghost-buttons/"

    - stat: "GetUplift's HVAC case study: removing a secondary CTA increased phone conversions by 18% and form completions by 45%, demonstrating that in high-intent single-action scenarios, the secondary CTA creates harmful decision friction."
      source: "https://getuplift.co/the-psychology-of-a-cta-button/"

    - stat: "By 2025, above-the-fold attention is estimated at roughly 40% of total page view time, compared to 80% in 2010 and 57% in 2018, meaning secondary CTAs placed mid-page and below are reaching an increasingly engaged and scroll-committed audience."
      source: "https://cxl.com/blog/above-the-fold/"

  counterpoints:
    - point: "The secondary CTA can actively harm conversion if introduced carelessly. Choice Overload psychology (Paradox of Choice) shows that two equally prominent CTAs create decision paralysis, causing visitors to delay action or abandon the page entirely. The correct interpretation is not 'avoid secondary CTAs' but 'ensure they are visually and contextually subordinate at all times.'"
      source: "https://getuplift.co/the-psychology-of-a-cta-button/"

    - point: "Some leading UX voices argue that a single, well-crafted primary CTA universally outperforms dual-CTA designs. Unbounce's research suggests single CTAs convert 266% better when the page is designed to qualify and funnel visitors toward one clear action — implying that secondary CTAs may indicate an underperforming value proposition rather than a strategic necessity."
      source: "https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-cta/"

    - point: "The BMG360 'Learn More' test is a cautionary data point: adding a secondary CTA to a high-performing primary CTA caused a net decline in target conversions despite increasing total engagement. More clicks does not equal better outcomes. Teams must measure secondary CTA impact on the primary conversion goal, not just on secondary action volume."
      source: "https://www.bmg360.com/blog/post/do-more-choices-mean-more-conversions-a-cta-button-test"

    - point: "Smashing Magazine's foundational design principles caution against adding complexity without a demonstrably better outcome. A secondary CTA adds visual and cognitive complexity to the hero section — it should only be introduced when there is evidence (from scroll maps, heatmaps, or exit surveys) that a significant portion of visitors are leaving because they need more information, not because the primary offer is unclear."

  case_studies:
    - title: "Slack's Dual-CTA Hero: 'Try for Free' + 'Talk to Sales'"
      summary: "Slack's homepage pairs a high-saturation primary CTA ('Try for free') with a secondary option ('Talk to sales') styled as a less prominent button or text link. This directly addresses two fundamentally different visitor types — individual users ready to self-serve and enterprise decision-makers who need a human conversation. The secondary CTA is not a fallback; it is a distinct conversion path for a distinct segment. Slack also uses device-adaptive CTA copy, changing button text based on the visitor's operating system."

    - title: "HubSpot's Hero: 'Get started free' + 'Get a demo'"
      summary: "HubSpot uses a consistent dual-CTA pattern across its product pages, where 'Get started free' is the primary filled button and 'Get a demo' is a secondary ghost or outlined button. This pattern maps directly to purchase funnel position: the free trial captures self-directed, lower-friction conversions while the demo request captures higher-value enterprise leads who need validation before committing. The two CTAs serve different revenue streams, making this a business-model-driven dual CTA rather than a hedging strategy."
      source: "https://nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy/"

    - title: "Courier Exchange Restructured CTA Hierarchy: Leads Doubled in One Month"
      summary: "NerdCow's case study of Courier Exchange shows that restructuring CTA hierarchy — giving each action a clear visual level rather than treating all buttons as equally prominent — doubled the number of inbound leads within one month. The restructuring involved demoting secondary actions to ghost buttons or text links, tightening CTA copy to be more specific, and removing duplicate labeling across sections."
      source: "https://nerdcow.co.uk/blog/cta-hierarchy/"

    - title: "HVAC Company: Removing Secondary CTA Increases Both Conversion Paths"
      summary: "GetUplift's HVAC case study ran an A/B test removing a secondary CTA from the hero section. Counterintuitively, both the primary phone conversion (up 18%) and form completions (up 45%) improved once the secondary CTA was removed. This confirms that high-intent visitors — such as those looking for emergency or urgent service — are served better by one clear, unambiguous action than by a choice that introduces hesitation."

    - title: "Microsoft Teams: Unconventional Primary CTA 'See plans and pricing'"
      summary: "Rather than a standard signup or trial button, Microsoft Teams uses 'See plans and pricing' as its primary CTA — a pattern that acknowledges the enterprise buying process, where cost validation precedes commitment. Secondary CTAs on the same page lead to feature tours or demos. This demonstrates that the primary/secondary relationship must be calibrated to visitor intent and the sales cycle length, not just to generic UX conventions."

    - title: "Airbnb's Search-First Hero as a Zero-CTA Conversion Pattern"
      summary: "Airbnb replaces both primary and secondary CTAs with an embedded search widget as the hero's primary interactive element. The 'secondary' action — browsing inspiration by destination — appears as a scrollable card strip below. This demonstrates that for transaction-heavy businesses, the conventional dual-CTA model may be replaced entirely by immediate-action interfaces. The implication for smaller businesses is that a booking widget or quote calculator can serve as a primary conversion mechanism, with a traditional CTA as the secondary fallback."
