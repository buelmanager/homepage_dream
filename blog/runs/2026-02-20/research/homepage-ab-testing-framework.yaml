  frameworks:
    - title: "PIE Framework (Potential, Importance, Ease)"
      description: "Originated by Conversion President Chris Goward. Evaluates test opportunities on three dimensions: (1) Potential — how much improvement possible on target page using analytics and user research; (2) Importance — traffic volume and value; direct impact on business goals; (3) Ease — technical complexity and organizational barriers. Teams score each dimension numerically for objective prioritization."
      source: "https://conversion.com/framework/pie-framework/"
    - title: "ICE Framework (Impact, Confidence, Effort)"
      description: "Popularized by Sean Ellis and GrowthHackers. Three-variable prioritization model: (1) Impact — potential impact if test succeeds; (2) Confidence — likelihood test will work based on existing data; (3) Effort — resource and time requirements for implementation. Often paired with PIE for programs running dozens of overlapping tests."
      source: "https://speero.com/post/how-to-prioritize-your-a-b-tests-ideas"
    - title: "LIFT Model (6 Conversion Factors)"
      description: "Helps analyze web and mobile experiences and develop A/B test hypotheses. Draws on six conversion factors from visitor perspective: (1) Value Proposition — clarity of unique benefits; (2) Clarity — understanding what to do; (3) Relevance — personal connection; (4) Distraction — competing elements; (5) Urgency — motivation to act now; (6) Anxiety — concerns preventing conversion."
      source: "https://vwo.com/ab-testing/"
    - title: "Optimizely Six-Step A/B Testing Process"
      description: "(1) Collect data using analytics, heatmaps, user research to identify opportunities; (2) Set clear goals with specific metrics and improvement targets; (3) Create test hypothesis based on existing data; (4) Design variations with measurable changes; (5) Run experiment with random traffic splitting; (6) Analyze results checking statistical significance."
      source: "https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/"
    - title: "EASIER Framework (Complementary to PIE)"
      description: "Determines what to test once high-value areas identified via PIE. Evaluates: (1) Evidence quality; (2) Business alignment; (3) Test duration; (4) Financial impact; (5) Resource requirements; (6) Productionalization likelihood. Two-stage approach creates comprehensive systematic testing roadmap."

  counterpoints:
    - point: "A/B testing overhead can exceed benefits — setting up tracking, achieving statistical significance, and managing multiple tests requires significant resources; small businesses may see better ROI from other optimization methods"
      source: "https://www.alexbirkett.com/best-ab-testing-tools/"
    - point: "Test duration creates false positives when teams stop too early — results may appear significant but haven't stabilized; requires discipline to run minimum 1-2 weeks per Optimizely guidance"
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - point: "Multiple simultaneous tests on same page confound results — changing CTA button color, headline, and hero image together makes it impossible to identify which change drove conversions"
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - point: "Mobile vs. desktop optimization tension — 60% mobile traffic but many teams only optimize 40% user experience; responsive design A/B testing often overlooked leading to suboptimal mobile conversions"
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - point: "Beautiful design does not guarantee conversions — visually stunning homepage may underperform if copy, clarity, and CTA hierarchy are weak; form over function fallacy in homepage design"
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - point: "Insufficient traffic invalidates results — pages with low weekly traffic struggle to achieve 95% statistical significance; requires minimum audience volume"

  critical_mistakes:
    - mistake: "Testing without hypothesis"
      detail: "Running tests on hunch or assumption without explicit if-then statement makes results untrustworthy and prevents learning. Hypothesis must connect specific change to predicted outcome with underlying reason."
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - mistake: "Ignoring conversion path context"
      detail: "Testing low-traffic pages or pages outside conversion path wastes resources. Focus on high-traffic pages critical to sales funnel; homepage qualifies only if it drives toward conversion."
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - mistake: "Stopping tests early"
      detail: "Temptation to halt successful-looking tests before reaching 95% statistical significance leads to false positives. Results appear conclusive but haven't stabilized; requires minimum 1-2 weeks per traffic patterns."
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - mistake: "Multiple element changes simultaneously"
      description: "Changing CTA button, headline, and hero image together prevents identifying which change drove results. Isolating variables is fundamental to understanding impact."
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - mistake: "Overlooking mobile experience"
      detail: "60%+ of traffic is mobile but teams don't test responsive design changes across devices. Results may be positive on desktop but fail on mobile, breaking actual user experience."
      source: "https://contentsquare.com/guides/ab-testing/mistakes/"
    - mistake: "Poor documentation"
      detail: "Failing to record hypotheses, data sources, implementation details, and learnings prevents institutional knowledge building. Teams repeat failed tests or miss valuable insights for future optimization."
