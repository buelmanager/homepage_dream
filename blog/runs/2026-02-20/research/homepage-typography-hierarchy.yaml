  expert_opinions:
    - who: "Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g)"
      opinion: "Typography must follow semantic hierarchy with only one H1 per page, and headings should be structured hierarchically (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections). Visual contrast through font size is necessary but insufficient for accessibility—semantic HTML tagging is critical for screen reader users."
      source: "W3C - Headings | Web Accessibility Initiative"

    - who: "Figma Design Resources"
      opinion: "Effective typographic hierarchy creates visual harmony by limiting distinct header styles to 3-4 options. Font sizing should scale proportionally from a base size using consistent ratios (1.25, 1.333, or 1.5), allowing quick root-level adjustments for accessibility and scaling."
      source: "Figma - Ultimate Guide to Typography in Design"

    - who: "Toptal Typography Experts"
      opinion: "Typographic hierarchy is a roadmap that uses variant font sizes, colors, and spacing to show content importance. Poor hierarchy forces users to spend extra mental energy deciphering what matters. Effective hierarchy reduces cognitive load and improves scannability."
      source: "Toptal - How to Structure an Effective Typographic Hierarchy"

    - who: "Learn UI Design (Erik Kennedy)"
      opinion: "Body text should start at 16 pixels minimum for web readability. For longer reading formats, consider 14-24px body copy, with all headers scaling relative to this baseline. Responsive design requires rem or em units for consistent, scalable sizing across all devices."
      source: "Learn UI Design - Font Size Guidelines for Responsive Websites"

    - who: "Kevin Powell (Web Designer & CSS Expert)"
      opinion: "A modular typographic scale creates visual harmony and saves design guesswork. Using relative units (rem/em) paired with responsive design ensures text adapts smoothly between screen sizes while maintaining clear hierarchy relationships."
      source: "Kevin Powell - Using a typographic scale"

    - who: "We Design Motion & Kinetic Typography Specialists"
      opinion: "Kinetic typography works when it has purpose—guiding users, confirming actions, or enhancing storytelling. Timing, easing, hierarchy, and purposeful motion matter more than flashy effects. Motion should make messages stick and enhance user satisfaction."

  counterpoints:
    - point: "Kinetic Typography Accessibility Risk: Motion can cause distress for users with vestibular disorders or photosensitivity. Prefers-reduced-motion media queries are non-negotiable; some users disable all animations, requiring fallback static typography."
      source: "Framer - 7 Emerging Web Design Trends for 2025"

    - point: "Over-Emphasis on Typography Trends: Bold, playful typography can distract from content clarity and reduce conversion rates. Convention-breaking typography should only be adopted when it demonstrably improves usability, not for aesthetic novelty."
      source: "Smashing Magazine - 10 Principles Of Good Web Design"

    - point: "Variable Fonts Performance Trade-off: While flexible, variable fonts increase file size compared to single-weight fonts. The performance cost may outweigh benefits for homepages with strict bandwidth budgets or mobile-first audiences."
      source: "Web Design Trends 2026 - Performance-focused analysis"

    - point: "Serif Font Readability Myth: While modern screens improve serif rendering, sans-serif fonts like Inter, Roboto, and Open Sans remain superior for small body text, especially on lower-resolution mobile devices."
      source: "Elegant Themes - Optimal Typography For Web Design In 2025"

    - point: "Skipping Heading Levels: While semantic H1-H2-H3 hierarchy is recommended, some modern sites skip levels (e.g., H1 to H4) for visual reasons. This breaks accessibility for screen reader users and SEO semantics."
