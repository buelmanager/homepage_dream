  trends:
    - point: "Hero video is becoming a core storytelling element in 2026 homepages, used to show products in action, provide founder messaging, share behind-the-scenes content, and deliver quick explainers—moving beyond purely decorative use"
      source: "https://www.gingeritsolutions.com/blog/web-design-trends-2026/"
    - point: "Performance is non-negotiable for video strategy: successful 2026 hero videos use lightweight formats, lazy loading, muted autoplay, and increasingly rely on fallback static images for mobile devices below 768px width"
      source: "https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/websites-with-video-background/"
    - point: "Video-first homepages are evolving toward device-aware delivery: HD 16:9 video (640x360 to 1920x1080) for desktop paired with static JPEG/WebP for mobile, often with CSS media queries managing the visual strategy"
      source: "https://hostadvice.com/blog/website-design/website-video-background/"
    - point: "File size discipline has emerged as the critical performance constraint: successful implementations keep embedded videos at 500KB ideally, 1-2MB maximum, with 3-7 seconds of looping content to maintain fast load times"
      source: "https://muffingroup.com/blog/websites-with-video-backgrounds/"
    - point: "Accessibility requirements for video backgrounds are now design-first: include play/pause controls, implement prefers-reduced-motion media queries, use video elements instead of GIFs (which are inaccessible), and provide captions or aria-labels for context"

  expert_opinions:
    - who: "Wyzowl (2026 Video Landing Page Analysis)"
      opinion: "Video landing pages demonstrate 26 awesome examples in 2026, proving that when video is paired with clear CTAs, strong copy, and thoughtful scroll behavior, conversion lifts are significant—but only when video directly supports the conversion goal, not distracts from it"
    - who: "WordStream (2026 Conversion Rate Optimization Research)"
      opinion: "Strategic video implementation on homepages shows 34–86% conversion uplift depending on quality, with the highest-performing videos being 30-60 seconds long (39% of marketers report this as most effective), suggesting precision over epics"
    - who: "Webflow Design Community"
      opinion: "Video backgrounds work best on experience-first pages (conferences, events, restaurants) that communicate atmosphere and brand vibe—but fail on pages promoting complex offers requiring explanation, where video becomes cognitive overload"
    - who: "Design TLC and Hero Video Optimization Experts"
      opinion: "Silent hero videos require dark overlays or gradient overlays (15-40% opacity) to maintain text contrast and readability; poster images are critical and should be optimized like standalone images with fetchpriority=high"
    - who: "Google Web.dev (LCP Optimization Guide 2025)"
      opinion: "Video LCP optimization centers on four subparts: (1) eliminate resource load delay by making video discoverable early, (2) eliminate render delay by removing blocking JS, (3) reduce load duration with compression and CDN, (4) reduce TTFB with backend optimization"

  statistics:
    - stat: "Websites with video show 4.8% average conversion rate versus 2.9% for sites without video—a 65% relative uplift"
      source: "https://www.designrush.com/agency/video-marketing/trends/video-marketing-statistics"
    - stat: "Landing pages with video achieve 34–86% higher conversion rates; B2B organizations using video report 27% higher MQL rates and 23% shorter sales cycles"
      source: "https://www.loopexdigital.com/blog/blog/video-marketing-statistics"
    - stat: "93% of marketers report video delivers strong ROI as of 2025—the highest recorded to date—indicating mainstream confidence in video strategy when executed properly"
      source: "https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"
    - stat: "Optimal video length for homepage impact is 30-60 seconds (39% of marketers), followed by 1-2 minutes (28%), with sub-3-minute clips converting at just 2%—providing clear technical targets"
      source: "https://www.goldcast.io/blog-post/55-video-marketing-statistics-to-drive-your-strategy-2025"
    - stat: "Over 60% of web traffic is mobile, meaning Core Web Vitals failures on mobile from poorly optimized video disproportionately impact the majority of visitors"
      source: "https://www.shopify.com/blog/homepage-design"
    - stat: "Video file sizes greater than 1-2MB create measurable LCP delays on 4G networks; keeping compressed video at 500KB is the performance sweet spot for sub-3-second delivery"
      source: "https://blog.openreplay.com/core-web-vitals-optimize-lcp/"

  counterpoints:
    - point: "Some designers argue against hero video entirely: video distracts from complex value propositions, creates accessibility friction (motion sensitivity, vestibular disorders), drains battery on mobile, and demands ongoing maintenance—simpler static hero designs often convert better for B2B and complex SaaS"
      source: "https://www.imarc.com/blog/hot-trend-hot-mess-homepage-background-videos"
    - point: "Animated GIFs are simpler than video for modest animations, though they are significantly larger (3-10x file size vs. compressed MP4) and lack native accessibility—video with native playback controls is the professional standard, but GIFs remain tempting for small teams"
      source: "https://cloudfour.com/thinks/accessible-animated-gif-alternatives/"
    - point: "LCP measurement treats video poster images and first-frame display time as the LCP candidate, not video playback, meaning slow poster image optimization can tank perceived video performance—many teams optimize video compression while neglecting the poster image"
      source: "https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/largest-contentful-paint"
    - point: "CSS background images for video create inherent discovery delays because browsers cannot preload unencountered CSS; converting to img elements or explicit preload directives is necessary but often overlooked, leading to invisible performance regressions"
      source: "https://www.corewebvitals.io/core-web-vitals/largest-contentful-paint"
    - point: "Mobile users on metered connections experience severe friction from video autoplay: bandwidth constraints, battery drain, and the inability to pause lead to silent video autoplay being hidden or disabled entirely by 30% of users—static fallback images are essential, not optional"

  case_studies:
    - title: "Y Yachts (Y.CO) Hero Video Strategy"
      summary: "Y.CO's homepage features a multi-layered video approach: primary hero video showing ocean silhouettes with luxury yachts bobbing in the background creates emotional resonance and sense of adventure. The video establishes brand feeling without overwhelming the primary CTA. Success metrics: background video directly supports the aspirational value proposition (luxury yacht experiences) while text overlays remain sharp through high-contrast design decisions."
      source: "https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/websites-with-video-background/"
    - title: "Restaurant/Event Industry Video Implementation"
      summary: "Hospitality brands (restaurants, event venues, hotels) successfully use short-form video (3-7 seconds looping) to communicate atmosphere and energy. Example: restaurant hero showing vibrant dining experience with guests laughing, food presentation, ambiance. File size optimization (500KB) ensures fast loading. Device-aware delivery uses static food photography on mobile. Success metric: converts atmosphere-curious visitors into reservation clicks."
      source: "https://www.twicpics.com/blog/3-examples-and-3-tips-for-engaging-hero-section-videos"
    - title: "B2B SaaS Rejection of Hero Video"
      summary: "Many B2B software companies deliberately avoid hero video backgrounds, finding that static hero sections with animated micro-interactions (button hover states, scroll reveals) outperform video for complex product homepages. Reason: visitors landing on SaaS homepages are task-focused (learn features, sign up) and video creates cognitive load. Success metric: higher CTR to demo/signup without video distraction."

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Technical Specifications for Hero Video"
      details: "16:9 aspect ratio, HD resolution (640x360 minimum to 1920x1080 maximum), MP4 or WebM format, 3-7 seconds of looping content, 500KB ideal file size (1-2MB maximum), 25-second duration ceiling. Use ffmpeg or Handbrake for compression: target bitrate 1000-2000 kbps for MP4."
    - practice: "LCP Optimization for Video Heroes"
      details: "Avoid lazy-loading LCP video; make it discoverable in initial HTML. Optimize poster image (serve in WebP/AVIF with fetchpriority='high'). Implement four LCP subpart optimizations: (1) early resource discovery via preload link, (2) remove blocking JS/CSS, (3) compress with CDN, (4) minimize TTFB via backend caching."
    - practice: "Mobile-First Fallback Strategy"
      details: "Use CSS media queries: hide video on screens below 768px, display optimized static JPEG or WebP instead. Alternatively, serve MP4 via media query sizes to smaller devices with lower bitrate versions. Test on actual mobile devices (4G networks) to measure LCP impact."
    - practice: "Accessibility & Inclusivity"
      details: "Include play/pause controls for users with motion sensitivity. Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable autoplay for accessibility-conscious users. Provide captions or aria-labels describing video content. Avoid blinking/flashing. Use video element (not animated GIF) for superior accessibility."
    - practice: "Visual Design Overlay Strategy"
      details: "Apply 15-40% opacity dark overlay or gradient to video background to maintain text contrast and readability of headline/copy. Test contrast ratio (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for regular text, 3:1 for large text). Use color overlays that reinforce brand identity."
    - practice: "Content Strategy Alignment"
      details: "Use video only for atmosphere/storytelling pages (events, restaurants, luxury brands), not for pages requiring complex explanation (SaaS, B2B products). Ensure video directly supports primary CTA and conversion goal. Avoid generic 'vibes' videos; use brand-specific or custom footage that differentiates."
    - practice: "Testing & Monitoring"
      details: "Measure LCP, FID, CLS impact before and after video implementation. Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and WebPageTest. Monitor actual user metrics via Web Vitals API. A/B test video vs. static hero to validate conversion impact for your specific audience."
