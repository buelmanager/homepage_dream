  expert_opinions:
    - who: "Adam Fellows (UX Stack Exchange)"
      opinion: "Almost all of the testing I have managed has proven content delivered via carousels to be missed by users. Few interact with them and many comment that they look like adverts — demonstrating banner blindness in practice."

    - who: "Joshua Porter (UX Design)"
      opinion: "Humans are most comfortable when they feel in control of themselves and their environment. Thoughtless software takes away that comfort by forcing people into unplanned interactions — a direct critique of auto-rotating carousels."

    - who: "Craig Kistler (UX Stack Exchange)"
      opinion: "The chances that information being displayed in the carousel matches what the visitor is looking for is slim. The first thing the visitor does is scroll right past it — exposing the relevance mismatch problem at the core of homepage carousels."

    - who: "Chris Goward (Wider Funnel, conversion optimization expert)"
      opinion: "We have tested rotating offers many times and have found it to be a poor way of presenting home page content. The A/B test data consistently shows static alternatives outperform sliders."

    - who: "Blair Keen (Adobe Optimization Manager)"
      opinion: "Removing a carousel slider entirely — raising all content below it — resulted in a 23% increase in sales for a financial services client. The absence of the carousel was itself a conversion optimization."

    - who: "Conversion optimization experts (Orbit Media / The Good)"
      opinion: "Among the hundreds of website audits completed in which carousels were causing poor conversion, when clients killed their carousel, they typically increased their conversion significantly. The pattern is consistent across industries."

  statistics:
    - stat: "Only 1% of homepage visitors click on auto-forwarding carousel slides (Notre Dame University study), and of that 1%, 84% click exclusively on the first slide — meaning slides 2, 3, and beyond receive virtually zero engagement."
      source: "https://thegood.com/insights/ecommerce-image-carousels/ (citing Notre Dame University)"

    - stat: "In a B2B site survey by Search Engine Land, the click-through rate for homepage carousels was 0.65% (32 clicks out of 5,000 visits) — well under 1% overall engagement."
      source: "https://erikrunyon.com/2013/01/carousel-interaction-stats/"

    - stat: "A/B test for a financial services client (Adobe): removing the carousel entirely resulted in a 23% increase in sales. No other element was changed."
      source: "https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/rotating-sliders-hurt-website/"

    - stat: "Grizzly Zoo (online pet store) A/B test by Conversionista: static image version received clicks 40% of the time; carousel version received only 2% clicks — a 20x difference in engagement. Eye-tracking confirmed users actively avoided the carousel."
      source: "http://www.websiteoptimizers.com/blog/home-page-carousels-good-ultimate-guide-existing-studies-real-data/"

    - stat: "First slide in a carousel gets 40% of clicks; second slide gets 18%; third gets 11%; engagement drops steeply with each subsequent position — effectively making all slides beyond the first invisible to most visitors."
      source: "https://thegood.com/insights/ecommerce-image-carousels/"

    - stat: "Only 47% of sites currently meet Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds, with poor performance leading to losses of 8-35% in conversions, rankings, and revenue. Sites with LCP above 3 seconds experience 23% more traffic loss than faster competitors."
      source: "https://triare.medium.com/core-web-vitals-2025-how-performance-affects-business-reputation-online-39aeda66539f"

    - stat: "Pages with poor CLS scores (above 0.15) experienced 19% more traffic loss than competitors with stable layouts. Auto-playing carousels are one of the most common sources of CLS on homepages."
      source: "https://skyseodigital.com/core-web-vitals-optimization-complete-guide-for-2026/"

    - stat: "Sites with poor INP scores above 300ms experienced 31% more traffic loss than competitors — carousel JavaScript interaction handlers are a common INP contributor on sites using heavyweight slider libraries."
      source: "https://skyseodigital.com/core-web-vitals-optimization-complete-guide-for-2026/"

    - stat: "Over 60% of web traffic is now mobile (Shopify 2025 data), amplifying the cost of carousel-related performance failures since mobile devices are disproportionately affected by heavy JavaScript and large image payloads."
      source: "https://www.shopify.com/blog/homepage-design"

  counterpoints:
    - point: "Product image galleries inside e-commerce product detail pages are a legitimate and effective use case for carousels. Users expect to browse through multiple product angles in a controlled, on-demand manner — this differs fundamentally from a homepage hero carousel trying to deliver marketing messages."
      source: "https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/carousel"

    - point: "User-controlled carousels (no auto-rotation, navigation arrows visible, 3-5 slides maximum) perform significantly better than auto-rotating versions. The anti-carousel consensus applies specifically to auto-playing, auto-advancing sliders — not to all paginated content displays."
      source: "https://mailchimp.com/resources/carousel-slider-design-best-practices/"

    - point: "One auto-rotating homepage in a multi-site study achieved an 8.8% click rate from homepage visitors — higher than many static alternatives. Context matters: brand recognition, carousel content quality, and category relevance can affect whether a carousel performs above average."
      source: "https://www.cheapwebdesign.co.uk/blog/how-effective-are-interactive-carousels-on-websites-in-2023-the-stats/"

    - point: "The 1% click-through statistic often cited against carousels dates primarily from 2013 studies. Modern carousels with better UX implementation (clear navigation dots, swipe support, motion-reduced versions) may perform differently — though the bulk of current evidence still favors static alternatives."
      source: "https://www.cheapwebdesign.co.uk/blog/how-effective-are-interactive-carousels-on-websites-in-2023-the-stats/"

    - point: "Some organizations use carousels as a political compromise — multiple departments each want their content featured above the fold. In this context, a well-constrained carousel (3 slides, user-controlled, clear narrative thread) may be a pragmatic solution even if it is not the conversion-optimal choice."

  case_studies:
    - title: "Adobe Financial Services: 23% Sales Increase After Carousel Removal"
      summary: "Adobe Optimization Manager Blair Keen ran an A/B test for a financial services client where the homepage slider was completely removed and content below it was raised. The no-carousel variant produced a 23% increase in sales with no other changes. This is one of the most-cited controlled experiments demonstrating the direct commercial cost of homepage carousels."

    - title: "Grizzly Zoo (Conversionista): Static Image Receives 20x More Clicks Than Carousel"
      summary: "Conversionista A/B tested a homepage carousel against a single static image for online pet store Grizzly Zoo. The static image was clicked 40% of the time; the carousel was clicked only 2% of the time. Eye-tracking data confirmed users actively avoided the carousel area — treating it as banner advertising — while showing strong engagement with the static hero image."
      source: "http://www.websiteoptimizers.com/blog/home-page-carousels-good-ultimate-guide-existing-studies-real-data/"

    - title: "Notre Dame University: 1% Click Rate with 84% First-Slide Concentration"
      summary: "A 2013 study at the University of Notre Dame tracked carousel interaction across campus website visitors. Only 1% clicked any carousel element. Of those who did click, 84% clicked the first slide — showing that slides in positions 2 through 5 are effectively invisible even to the small fraction of users who engage with the carousel at all."
      source: "https://thegood.com/insights/ecommerce-image-carousels/"

    - title: "Financial Services Firm: Carousel CLS Creating Infinite Layout Shift"
      summary: "Portent's Core Web Vitals analysis documented a case where an auto-playing homepage carousel with non-composited CSS transitions was generating continuous CLS events on every slide change. The carousel registered a CLS score above 0.25 (classified as 'Poor' by Google) on desktop and was listed as the primary cause of the site's failing Page Experience score. Switching to CSS transform-based transitions resolved the CLS issue."

    - title: "Carousel vs Static: Mintminds E-commerce Product Page Experiment"
      summary: "Mintminds ran a controlled experiment adding USP text overlays to product page carousels. Adding contextual copy to existing carousel slides produced a measurable cart rate uplift — demonstrating that when carousels are used in appropriate contexts (product pages, not homepage hero), copy-driven optimization can improve their effectiveness."

  technical_notes:
    lcp_impact:
      - issue: "Homepage carousels frequently contain the page's Largest Contentful Paint element. If the LCP image is not the first slide, it may not be preloaded, causing LCP to fail Google's 2.5-second threshold."
        fix: "Load the first slide via HTML markup (not JavaScript). Add fetchpriority='high' and preload link for the first carousel image. Use srcset for responsive delivery."
      - issue: "Auto-playing carousels cause LCP to recalculate on each slide change because a new large image becomes the candidate element — resulting in repeated LCP measurements that confuse performance tooling."
        fix: "Avoid auto-play on LCP-candidate carousels. If auto-play is required, ensure only the first slide image is LCP-eligible using explicit image sizing."

    cls_impact:
      - issue: "Slide transitions using layout-inducing CSS properties (left, top, width, margin) cause layout shifts on every animation cycle. Auto-playing carousels create endless CLS throughout the page session."
        fix: "Use CSS transform: translateX() exclusively for slide transitions. Reserve fixed dimensions for all carousel container elements. Ensure navigation controls (dots, arrows) have statically allocated space."
      - issue: "Dynamic injection of navigation controls (dots, arrows) after JavaScript initializes shifts layout elements that were already painted — a common pattern in heavyweight carousel libraries (Slick, Owl Carousel)."
        fix: "Pre-render navigation controls in HTML with visibility:hidden if needed, then reveal via JavaScript — never inject new DOM nodes that cause reflow."

    inp_impact:
      - issue: "Heavy carousel JavaScript event handlers (touch, swipe, resize, intersection observer callbacks) block the main thread and delay INP response times above the 200ms threshold."
        fix: "Replace JavaScript carousel libraries with CSS Scroll Snap API (scroll-snap-type: x mandatory on container, scroll-snap-align: start on items). Zero JavaScript, zero INP penalty."
