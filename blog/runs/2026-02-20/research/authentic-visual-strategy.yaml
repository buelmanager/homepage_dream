        Adobe's 2026 Creative Trends report identifies 'Local Flavor' as one of four dominant
        visual strategies, explicitly calling for brands to showcase regional craftsmanship and
        community stories rather than generic global stock imagery. The report states: 'When
        people see themselves or their communities represented, it humanizes your business.'
        Collaborating with local creators and highlighting authentic regional moments are cited
        as the primary mechanism for building instant audience trust.

        Consumers in 2026 are gravitating away from over-polished, artificial content toward
        'the messy, the tactile, and the analog.' Adobe's trend research confirms that as AI
        and AR technology proliferates, audiences increasingly prize genuine textures, real
        people, and authentic narratives as signals of trustworthiness and human connection.
        70% of consumer decisions are driven by emotion, making visual relatability a direct
        business lever.

        Food and beverage photography trends for 2025-2026 have shifted from perfect plating
        to deliberate 'realness.' The new standard is natural soft light, mid-bite shots, and
        in-action scenes — imagery that shows texture and emotional experience rather than
        studio-perfect composure. This reflects a broader visual authenticity movement across
        all industry verticals on the web.

        Custom brand photography is now framed by industry professionals as a business essential
        rather than a luxury, driven by the surge of visual-first platforms (Instagram, TikTok,
        Pinterest) and the growing consumer demand for genuine brand connections. Brands that
        show 'their real side win loyalty' — with custom photography humanizing businesses and
        making them relatable and approachable.

        Custom illustrations are growing as a top brand differentiation tool in 2025-2026,
        particularly for brands that cannot produce premium lifestyle photography. Brand
        illustration case studies from Nissan, Costa Coffee, HOFF Sneakers, Tesco, and
        Transport for London all demonstrate that bespoke illustration creates premium brand
        perception and emotional connection that stock photography cannot replicate.
        The trend is moving toward 'genuine creative partnerships' rather than decorative
        visual add-ons.

        Users actively ignore generic stock photos in favor of authentic images. Eyetracking
        research shows users spend 10% more time viewing portrait photos of real people than
        reading accompanying biographies. NN/g's core principle is that 'users pay close
        attention to photos and other images that contain relevant information but ignore
        fluffy pictures used to jazz up web pages.' The group explicitly recommends investing
        in a quality photographer, noting: 'A great photographer can add a fortune to your
        website's business value.'

      opinion: >
        NN/g identifies 'avoiding generic stock photos' as one of seven core principles for
        effective web imagery. The rationale: stock imagery lacks specificity and memorability,
        and users overlook photos they have seen before. The group recommends featuring actual
        products, real team members, and showing products in realistic contexts as they are
        actually used — including the environment and target audience.

      opinion: >
        Stock photos fail brands because they lack differentiation — non-exclusive licensing
        means your competitors may use identical images. The recommended alternative is
        illustrated design, which offers full creative ownership, narrative control, inclusive
        representation, and emotional engagement. One key statistic: people following illustrated
        instructions achieve 323% more successful task completion compared to non-illustrated
        instructions, demonstrating the cognitive superiority of custom visuals.

        'People buy from brands they feel connected to. Custom photography shows your real team,
        your real products, your real story.' The agency notes that stock photos are universally
        accessible, meaning competitors may use identical images, which directly undermines
        brand uniqueness and consumer confidence. Custom photography creates a reusable visual
        library supporting cohesive branding across websites, social media, email, and advertising.

      opinion: >
        From 2025 case studies: in a world saturated with polished digital visuals, handcrafted
        and bespoke illustrated elements feel most luxurious and authentic. The strategic shift
        is from using illustration as decoration to genuine creative partnerships. Three critical
        lessons: brands that give illustrators ambitious projects and adequate execution time
        produce work that captures genuine public attention; personal elements inject authentic
        humanity into brand experiences; and custom illustration elevates ordinary categories
        into premium encounters.

        Stock photography still has valid use cases and should not be entirely dismissed,
        particularly for brands with lower budgets or shorter project timelines. Stock images
        are instantly downloadable and can be integrated within minutes, whereas creating
        custom visuals requires days or weeks. For blog post illustrations, background textures,
        and supporting imagery in non-critical positions, well-chosen stock photos remain a
        reasonable option.

    - point: >
        The impact of authentic photography varies significantly by business type and context.
        For some service businesses where the core offering is abstract (financial advice,
        software products, consulting), authentic photography of the team or office may not
        necessarily outperform a well-chosen stock image that communicates the concept clearly.
        A/B testing is always recommended over assuming authentic photos will universally win.

    - point: >
        Modern stock photography platforms have substantially improved quality and diversity
        in 2025, moving toward imagery that 'feels like user-generated content' rather than
        obviously staged corporate photos. For businesses with severely constrained budgets,
        carefully selected diverse and candid-feeling stock imagery is a legitimate bridge
        strategy while building toward custom photography — dismissing all stock imagery
        as harmful oversimplifies the decision.

        Custom photography and illustration investments carry risks if not executed well.
        Low-quality custom photography can damage brand credibility more severely than
        a well-chosen stock image. The key differentiator is image quality and specificity,
        not solely whether the photo is 'real' or 'stock.' A poorly lit selfie of a team
        is less credible than a high-quality contextual stock image.

        Superside acknowledges that stock photos may still work 'for the odd blog post,'
        suggesting limited, non-critical applications remain acceptable. The recommendation
        to abandon stock photos entirely applies to hero sections, team pages, service
        showcases, and trust-building contexts — not necessarily every image on a website.

    - title: "Tesco Finest Tea — Custom Illustration Elevating Retail to Premium"
      summary: >
        Tesco used custom illustrations by artist Tom Haugomat to depict five global tea
        cultivation regions on their Finest Tea packaging and digital materials. The cinematic
        quality and delicate textural imperfections delivered a 'handmade, authentic quality'
        that transformed the product from commodity to craftsmanship. The result elevated an
        ordinary retail category into an aspirational, premium encounter — demonstrating how
        custom illustration achieves what stock photography cannot: specific, branded visual
        storytelling.

    - title: "Costa Coffee — Artist-Led Festival Branding for Authentic Connection"
      summary: >
        Costa Coffee partnered with illustrator Luke McConkey for the Boardmasters festival
        in Cornwall, creating vibrant, spontaneous artwork including reversible bucket hats
        and installations that became genuine festival essentials. McConkey incorporated his
        own family members into the artwork, injecting personal, human authenticity into the
        brand experience. This approach went beyond logo placement to create emotional
        resonance — the antithesis of stock-photo-based marketing.

    - title: "Transport for London — Illustration for Community-Led Trust Building"
      summary: >
        Transport for London used custom illustration (Baby on Board badges, Night Tube artwork
        by Charlie Davis) to build emotional connections with communities rather than defaulting
        to corporate photography or generic stock imagery. A public institution showed that
        bespoke illustration enables organizations to express values in ways that feel genuinely
        personal rather than bureaucratic — directly paralleling what small businesses need
        to achieve on their homepages.

      summary: >
        MarketingExperiments conducted an A/B test comparing a real customer photo against
        a top-performing stock image on a sign-up page. Visitors who saw the real customer
        photo were 35% more likely to sign up for the service. This is one of the most
        frequently cited controlled experiments demonstrating the measurable conversion
        advantage of authentic imagery on web pages.

      summary: >
        Industry guidance for spa homepages recommends hiring a photographer specifically to
        capture the spa's ambiance through lifestyle photography: tranquil treatment rooms,
        relaxation lounges, product displays, and real service interactions (masseuses giving
        massages, estheticians performing facials with smiling staff). This approach helps
        prospective customers visualize the experience and feel comfortable — a conversion
        strategy rooted in authentic visual storytelling rather than generic wellness stock imagery.

    - title: "HOFF Sneakers — Minimalist Custom Illustration as Brand Identity"
      summary: >
        HOFF Sneakers collaborated with artist Malika Favre on a Mexican Bauhaus collection,
        applying her distinctive minimalist aesthetic to location-focused footwear designs.
        The artist became a genuine creative collaborator, not just a decorator, strengthening
        the brand's visual identity with illustration that no stock imagery library could
        replicate. This case demonstrates how even product-based businesses can use custom
        illustration as a strategic authenticity signal rather than defaulting to product
        photography alone.
