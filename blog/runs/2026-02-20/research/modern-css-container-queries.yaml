    - point: >
        Container queries have reached production readiness with baseline browser support
        since 2023 and 90%+ U.S. traffic coverage by late 2025. They enable component-level
        responsive design — cards, navigation bars, hero sections, and sidebar widgets adapt
        based on their parent container's width rather than the viewport, eliminating the need
        for JavaScript resize listeners.

        OKLCH color space global support exceeded 92% in Q2 2025 across Chrome, Edge,
        Firefox, and Safari. It unlocks P3 display color richness — approximately 50% more
        colors than traditional sRGB/RGB — while providing perceptually uniform lightness
        that makes design system palette generation more predictable and accessible.

    - point: >
        The :has() pseudo-class reverses traditional CSS selector logic, allowing parent
        elements to be styled based on the state of their children. Practical homepage
        applications include: disabling body scroll when a modal is open, creating
        JavaScript-free dark mode toggles, and conditionally showing navigation sub-menus.

        text-wrap: balance automatically distributes words equally across lines, solving
        the "orphaned word" problem on hero headlines and card titles without manual <br>
        tags or JavaScript. It is limited to 6 lines (Chromium) or 10 lines (Firefox),
        making it ideal for above-the-fold headings.

    - point: >
        The native HTML <dialog> element provides built-in accessible modal behavior —
        Esc key close, focus trapping, show/hide methods, and a ::backdrop pseudo-element
        for overlay styling — replacing heavy third-party modal libraries with zero
        JavaScript dependencies for basic use cases.

    - point: >
        CSS in 2025 is taking over logic and state management previously reserved for
        JavaScript. The State of CSS 2025 survey shows significant growth in native CSS
        capabilities including scroll snap, view transitions, cascade layers, and scroll-state
        queries — all reducing page weight and JavaScript dependency on homepage designs.

    - point: >
        Container scroll-state queries (Chrome/Edge/Opera only as of early 2026) allow
        navigation bars to detect their own stuck/snapped scroll state and change styling
        without JavaScript scroll event listeners — a clean pattern for sticky nav transitions.

  expert_opinions:
    - who: "Smashing Magazine (Vitaly Friedman) — New Front-End Features For Designers In 2025"
      opinion: >
        Five native browser features — container queries, :has(), text-wrap balance,
        OKLCH, and the native dialog element — collectively eliminate entire categories of
        JavaScript dependency and design compromise. These features remain under-adopted
        despite broad availability, and homepage builders stand to gain immediate wins in
        responsive layout, typography polish, color richness, and accessible modals.
        Crucially, they bridge the gap between designer and developer workflows.

    - who: "Kevin Powell (CSS educator, YouTube — 'CSS is Awesome')"
      opinion: >
        Container queries represent a fundamental shift toward component-based design.
        Rather than building layouts around viewport breakpoints, developers can now build
        truly self-contained, layout-agnostic components. His mini-series 'Style Query
        Spotlight' (June 2025) argues that style queries are changing the fundamental
        way CSS is written, enabling theme variants and density modes through custom
        properties instead of class toggles.

    - who: "Evil Martians engineering team"
      opinion: >
        OKLCH should be adopted for design systems and homepage color palettes because it
        is the first CSS color model that is both perceptually uniform and human-readable.
        Unlike HSL, adjusting the lightness axis in OKLCH does not shift perceived saturation.
        This makes generating accessible color scales (AA/AAA contrast ratios) far more
        predictable and reduces manual color correction effort.

    - who: "LogRocket Blog — Container Queries in 2026"
      opinion: >
        Container queries may be the most powerful responsive design feature since CSS Grid,
        but adoption remains surprisingly low: the 2025 State of CSS survey found only 41%
        of developers have used container size queries at all, and fewer than 1% adopted
        scroll-state queries. A key barrier is that design tools like Figma still lack
        native container query support, creating friction between design and development.

    - who: "Frontend Masters / Kevin Powell — Style Queries tutorial"
      opinion: >
        CSS style queries (a subset of container queries) are the right tool for component
        theme variants and density modes — use cases previously requiring JavaScript class
        manipulation or CSS-in-JS. Developers can now write component-scoped rules that
        respond to the value of a CSS custom property on the container.

        text-wrap: balance is capped at 6 lines (Chromium) and 10 lines (Firefox) for
        performance reasons — making it purpose-built for homepage hero headlines and

  counterpoints:
    - point: >
        Container queries cannot replace media queries. Viewport-level layout decisions
        (print styles, device orientation, prefers-color-scheme, prefers-reduced-motion)
        still require traditional media queries. The two systems are complementary, not
        competitive. Overuse of container queries can introduce performance penalties due
        to containment recalculation overhead.
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/"

    - point: >
        CSS style queries (using custom properties inside @container) lack full cross-browser
        support in early 2026; container scroll-state queries work only in Chrome, Edge,
        and Opera. Teams targeting Safari or Firefox users must treat these as progressive
        enhancements with fallbacks.
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/"

    - point: >
        Elements cannot query themselves — only children of a container element can respond
        to a container query. This "containment hierarchy" constraint requires teams to add
        extra wrapper elements, which can clash with existing semantic HTML structure and
        complicate markup.
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/"

    - point: >
        OKLCH migration complexity may not justify the effort for simple websites with
        a small, fixed color palette. Developer familiarity with RGB/HEX remains much
        higher industry-wide, and design tools (Figma as of early 2026) do not yet export
        OKLCH values natively, requiring manual conversion in CSS.
      source: "https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl"

    - point: >
        The native <dialog> element's styling flexibility is more limited than custom
        modal libraries. The ::backdrop pseudo-element and animation support have edge
        cases across browsers. Teams needing highly animated or deeply customized modal
        designs may still prefer a lightweight JS-driven solution.
      source: "https://css-tricks.com/getting-creative-with-html-dialog/"

    - point: >
        text-wrap: balance can cause minor layout shifts on initial render as the browser
        computes the optimal break point, which can affect Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
        scores. Its 6-line limit also means it does not benefit long-form body text.

  case_studies:
    - title: "Card Component — Context-Agnostic Layout with Container Queries"
      summary: >
        The canonical container query use case: a card component that switches from
        a stacked (portrait) layout to a horizontal (landscape) layout based on the
        width of its parent container, not the viewport. The same card renders correctly
        in a full-width homepage hero, a 3-column product grid, and a narrow sidebar —
        without a single media query or JavaScript resize listener.
        Code pattern:
          .card-wrapper { container-type: inline-size; }
          @container (min-width: 500px) { .card { display: flex; flex-direction: row; } }

    - title: "Sticky Navigation — Scroll-State Container Query (Progressive Enhancement)"
      summary: >
        Using container scroll-state queries (Chrome/Edge), a sticky navigation bar can
        detect its own 'stuck' state via @container (scroll-state(stuck: top)) and apply
        a background color, backdrop-filter blur, and reduced padding — the classic
        'shrinking nav on scroll' pattern — with zero JavaScript. As a progressive
        enhancement: non-supporting browsers receive the full-size nav permanently.
      source: "https://blog.logrocket.com/container-queries-2026/"

    - title: "Hero Headline Typography — text-wrap: balance"
      summary: >
        Applying text-wrap: balance to homepage hero <h1> elements eliminates awkward
        single-word orphans on the last line without manual line breaks. For a headline
        like 'Craft Coffee Roasted With Intention in Brooklyn', the browser automatically
        distributes words across two balanced lines regardless of viewport width. One CSS
        property replaces a JavaScript resize-observer solution previously required for
        this effect.

    - title: "OKLCH Design System — Stripe and Linear.app Color Palette Strategy"
      summary: >
        Engineering teams at companies like Stripe and Linear have adopted perceptually
        uniform color spaces for their design systems. OKLCH enables generating a complete
        tonal scale (50 through 950) where each step has a genuinely consistent perceived
        lightness jump. This produces accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA) predictably
        without manual spot-checking — a major time saving for homepage color palette design.

    - title: "JavaScript-Free Dark Mode Toggle with :has()"
      summary: >
        Using :has() + a hidden checkbox in the HTML, a homepage can implement a full
        dark/light mode toggle without a single line of JavaScript:
          html:has(#dark-toggle:checked) { color-scheme: dark; --bg: #1a1a1a; }
        The :has() selector watches the checkbox state and applies CSS custom property
        overrides globally. This replaces the previously required JS event listener +
        classList.toggle() pattern entirely.

    - title: "Native Modal for Homepage Lead Capture — <dialog> Element"
      summary: >
        Replacing a JS-library-dependent lead capture modal (newsletter signup, contact
        form overlay) with the native <dialog> element reduces modal implementation to
        HTML + minimal JS (dialog.showModal() / dialog.close()). Built-in Esc key
        handling, focus trapping, and ::backdrop overlay eliminate 3-5 accessibility
        bugs common in custom modal implementations. The ::backdrop pseudo-element
        provides a native animation hook for fade-in overlay effects.
