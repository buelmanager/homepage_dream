  case_studies:
    - title: "Recurring Giving Program Implementation"
      summary: "Nonprofits shifting from one-time ask strategies to recurring donor engagement saw monthly giving increase 5% in 2024 (vs. 3.5% overall growth). Organizations emphasizing consistent, brief stewardship touchpoints through storytelling achieved 45% retention versus 27% baseline. Strategy: Build homepage with recurring donation option as default, emphasize monthly impact messaging, and integrate email follow-up sequences."
      source: "https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/fundraising-trends-2026"

    - title: "Branded Donation Page Study"
      summary: "Donations made on nonprofit-branded donation pages averaged 38% larger than those on generic pages, with 70% of donors returning for a second gift to the branded page. This demonstrates that visual consistency and brand trust directly impact donation size and retention. Strategy: Ensure donation page maintains brand colors, logo, mission statement, and emotional imagery; avoid third-party checkout flows that break branding."
      source: "https://kanopi.com/blog/best-nonprofit-websites/"

    - title: "Sticky Donate Button Conversion Lift"
      summary: "Nonprofits deploying sticky donate buttons (persistent in navigation) saw 50% increase in donation volume. This outperformed below-fold buttons and static placement. The button text 'Support Our Work' or mission-specific copy (e.g., 'Give to Food Pantry') outperformed generic 'Donate Now' by 15-25%. Strategy: Test sticky button in upper right (standard convention) with action-oriented, mission-specific copy; A/B test color contrast (4.5:1 WCAG minimum)."
      source: "https://neonone.com/resources/blog/donate-button/"

    - title: "Trust Badge and Testimonial Stacking"
      summary: "Organizations combining charity evaluator badges (Charity Navigator, GuideStar) with donor testimonials and volunteer social proof achieved 15% baseline increase, with additional 15-20% uplift from testimonials. Five types of social proof work together: donor testimonials, volunteer reviews, partner endorsements, evaluator ratings, and measurable impact data. Placement near donation CTAs was critical. Strategy: Layer testimonials near CTAs; include real names, photos, and specific outcomes; add evaluator badges to footer and donation page."
      source: "https://nonprofithub.org/5-types-of-social-proof-every-nonprofit-should-add-to-their-website/"

    - title: "Storytelling-Driven Donation Page Redesign"
      summary: "Organizations restructuring donation pages to lead with a single character's story (specific moment, problem, turning point, impact, CTA) saw 22x higher information retention and emotional connection than fact-driven pages. Pairing story with high-quality image of the beneficiary (not stock photos) increased conversion 15-20%. Strategy: Replace generic 'We help X people' messaging with narrative arc; center beneficiary rather than organization; use authentic photography; end with specific, measurable impact statement."

author_notes: |
  Key tensions to explore:
  1. Donation buttons should be prominent (above fold + sticky), but excessive CTAs fragment attention—test strategically
  2. Trust badges provide 15% uplift but only if mission clarity and storytelling are strong—they are reinforcement, not substitutes
  3. Email (33%) outperforms website (17%) for inspiration, meaning homepage excellence alone won't solve fundraising challenges
  4. Mobile-first design (87% traffic) is non-negotiable, but responsive design without fast load times and simplified forms still loses donors

  Expert voices to potentially interview:
  - NN/g usability researcher specializing in nonprofit design
  - Neon One product lead on donation conversion
  - GoFundMe Pro storytelling consultant
  - Executive director or development officer from high-converting nonprofit (St. Jude, New Story, similar)
