  expert_opinions:
    - who: "Nielsen Norman Group"
      opinion: "Forms should follow the EAS framework — Eliminate first, Automate where possible, and Simplify what remains — minimizing user effort and cognitive load through structure, transparency, clarity, and support"
      source: "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/eas-framework-simplify-forms/"
    - who: "Baymard Institute"
      opinion: "Form field optimization is critical, with intelligent features like prefilling, browser auto-fills, and inferred selections improving checkout UX substantially. Labels should be positioned above fields, not inline, to remain visible while users type"

    - point: "Multi-step forms are not universally superior — success cases require specific conditions: very long forms (30+ fields), high user intent, or qualifying funnels where filtering unqualified leads is beneficial"
      source: "https://ivyforms.com/blog/your-multi-step-forms-are-killing-conversions/"
    - point: "Form field reduction may not be ideal in all contexts — if you create enough motivation to complete forms, the relative ease (number of fields) becomes less important"
      source: "https://ventureharbour.com/how-form-length-impacts-conversion-rates/"
    - point: "Mobile vs. desktop conversion gap is driven by user behavior differences (research vs. buying sessions) rather than form design alone, with technical factors like payment friction compounding the issue"
      source: "https://ventureharbour.com/how-form-length-impacts-conversion-rates/"
