  trends:
    - point: "Performance is now officially treated as a design discipline, not an engineering afterthought. Organica Agency's 2026 web design report states directly: 'A slow website is a website losing clients' — reframing speed as a client-retention design decision."
      source: "https://www.organica.agency/en/magazine/web-design-2026-what-we-learned-in-2025-and-the-trends-shaping-modern-websites/"

    - point: "Google replaced FID (First Input Delay) with INP (Interaction to Next Paint) in March 2024. The current Core Web Vitals triad is LCP (<= 2.5s), INP (<= 200ms), and CLS (<= 0.1). All homepage design decisions must now be evaluated against this updated standard."
      source: "https://nitropack.io/blog/most-important-core-web-vitals-metrics/"

    - point: "Only 43.4% of mobile sites currently meet Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds (as of mid-2025 Chrome UX Report), meaning the majority of mobile homepages fail to meet Google's minimum performance bar."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"

    - point: "Mobile-first design has shifted from a responsive checkbox to the primary design starting point. The Organica 2026 report explicitly states: 'Design first for smartphones, then for desktops,' emphasizing thumb-friendly interfaces, readable typography, and streamlined navigation."

  expert_opinions:
    - who: "Organica Agency (2026 Web Design Report)"
      opinion: "Loading speed has become more than a technical metric — it is a key factor for search visibility. The agency frames performance as an inseparable part of the design discipline, not a developer post-processing step. They explicitly argue that visual quality without performance is a failed design."
      source: "https://www.organica.agency/en/magazine/web-design-2026-what-we-learned-in-2025-and-the-trends-shaping-modern-websites/"

    - who: "Shopify (18 Best Homepage Design Examples, 2025)"
      opinion: "Over 60% of all web traffic is now mobile. Shopify frames this statistic as the primary justification for treating mobile performance as the default design target, not a secondary adaptation. Any homepage design that is not optimized for mobile is effectively failing the majority of its audience."
      source: "https://www.shopify.com/blog/homepage-design"

    - who: "web.dev / Google (LCP documentation)"
      opinion: "The Largest Contentful Paint element is most commonly a hero image or the largest visible text block above the fold. Hero section design decisions — image format, video use, font loading strategy — are therefore the single most direct design-side levers for LCP performance."
      source: "https://web.dev/articles/lcp"

    - who: "Gostellar CRO Guide (2025)"
      opinion: "The most beautiful hero section in the world is worthless if users bounce before it loads. The guide documents that hero section optimization produced an average 38% conversion lift — the highest measured improvement of any single page element — while emphasizing that speed and conversion are the same goal."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"

    - who: "Portent (Core Web Vitals Carousel Analysis)"
      opinion: "Carousels are among the most common CLS offenders on homepages. Autoplay carousel slide transitions can cause infinite CLS — layout shifts that repeat continuously — without the designer being aware, since the shifts are often invisible to the human eye during casual review."
      source: "https://portent.com/blog/design-dev/how-website-carousels-impact-core-web-vitals-and-best-practices.htm"

    - who: "DebugBear (Font Performance Guide)"
      opinion: "Web font swapping — where a fallback font renders first, then is replaced by the web font — is a primary cause of CLS on text-heavy homepages. The severity depends on how different the fallback and web font metrics are. Self-hosting fonts eliminates external DNS lookups and gives designers full control over the font-display strategy."

  statistics:
    - stat: "A 1-second delay in page load reduces conversions by 7%. Pages loading in 1 second achieve 3x higher conversion rates than pages loading in 5 seconds."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"

    - stat: "53% of mobile users abandon a page that takes longer than 3 seconds to load. This directly means that any mobile homepage exceeding the 3-second threshold loses more than half its audience before seeing any content."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"

    - stat: "Hero videos increase LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) by an average of 1.2 seconds. Using a static poster image as the initial placeholder instead of loading video immediately reduces initial load time by 42%."

    - stat: "70% of consumers say website speed influences their purchase decision. Poor mobile speed reduces mobile conversions by up to 50%."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"

    - stat: "Mobile conversion rates average 1-3%, while desktop conversion rates average 3-5%. The primary causes are small tap targets, limited screen space, and slower connections — all design-addressable problems."

    - stat: "Mobile now accounts for 62.66% of all global web traffic. Only 43.4% of mobile sites meet Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds, meaning performance gaps disproportionately damage the majority of visitors."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"

    - stat: "For every second of load delay, conversion rates drop by 4.42%. Optimizing hero sections produced an average 38% conversion lift — the highest improvement of any single on-page element."

    - stat: "$2.6 billion in annual e-commerce revenue is lost globally due to slow-loading websites."
      source: "https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/website-speed-statistics"

  counterpoints:
    - point: "GSAP is not inherently bad for performance. At 23KB gzipped, GSAP itself is lightweight. The real performance risk is not the library but misuse patterns: animating non-composited CSS properties (width, height, top, left), triggering layout recalculations, or loading the full GSAP bundle when only core features are needed. CSS-only animations using transform and opacity are GPU-composited and cost no layout recalculation — but they lack the sequencing and scroll-trigger control that many homepage designs require."
      source: "https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/24495-gsap-and-google-core-web-vitals/"

    - point: "Hero videos are not necessarily fatal to performance. A poster image + deferred video load strategy (load video after LCP is complete) can neutralize the LCP impact. The problem is specifically the default behavior of autoplay video as the LCP element, not video itself. Designers who separate 'video as background texture' from 'video as content' can use video responsibly."
      source: "https://cloudinary.com/blog/lazy-load-autoplay-videos-core-web-vitals"

    - point: "Google Fonts is not always the slow choice. With HTTP/2 and preconnect hints (rel='preconnect' to fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com), the performance gap between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts narrows significantly. The actual problem is loading too many font weights and not specifying font-display. Designers who request only the weights they use and add font-display: swap can achieve acceptable performance without self-hosting."
      source: "https://www.erwinhofman.com/blog/pagespeed-best-practices-guide-custom-google-fonts/"

    - point: "Carousels are not universally bad — they are contextually bad. The web.dev Web Vitals patterns documentation includes a section on implementing carousels correctly, indicating they remain a viable pattern when implemented with CSS transform-based transitions, HTML-markup-based content loading (not JavaScript), and proper reserved space for images to prevent CLS. The UX research problem (carousels are often ignored) is separate from the performance problem."
      source: "https://web.dev/patterns/web-vitals-patterns/carousels"

    - point: "Performance-first design can become an excuse for bland design. Designers who reflexively reject all video, animation, and rich imagery to hit performance targets may create homepages that are fast but fail to communicate brand quality, build trust, or differentiate from competitors. The goal is not minimum viable aesthetics — it is optimized aesthetics. Performance budgets should constrain design decisions, not eliminate them."

  case_studies:
    - title: "Hero Image Optimization: 62% Weight Reduction with WebP"
      summary: "A CRO case study by Gostellar documented that converting hero images from JPEG to WebP format reduced image weight by 62% with no perceptible visual quality loss. The study found that each additional 100KB in hero assets increased bounce rates by 1.8%, making format optimization one of the highest-ROI design-adjacent decisions. Progressive loading (gradient background loads instantly, image fades in) further improved perceived performance without changing the visual design."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"

    - title: "Poster Image Strategy Reduces LCP by 840ms"
      summary: "Implementing delayed video loading — using a static poster image as placeholder, then loading video only after critical content renders — reduced LCP by an average of 840ms across test sites. This is a design-level decision (choosing and optimizing the poster image) that has a direct, measurable performance outcome. The strategy allows designers to retain hero video as a brand experience tool without sacrificing Core Web Vitals scores."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"

    - title: "Typography Hero vs Image Hero: 76% Faster Load"
      summary: "A performance comparison between typography-focused hero sections (large display type, minimal imagery) and image-heavy hero sections showed that text-led designs loaded 76% faster. This data point is reframing the 'bold text hero' trend from a purely stylistic choice into a performance-conscious design strategy, giving designers a performance justification for a visual direction that was already gaining traction."
      source: "https://www.gostellar.app/blog/high-impact-hero-sections-that-dont-hurt-page-speed"

    - title: "Autoplay Carousel CLS: The Invisible Infinite Shift"
      summary: "Portent's Core Web Vitals analysis identified autoplay carousels as a particularly insidious CLS source because the layout shifts from slide transitions can repeat indefinitely — each transition creating a new shift event — while remaining invisible to a designer reviewing the page casually. The total CLS score accumulates over session time, heavily penalizing pages where carousels are a primary homepage design feature. The fix is CSS transform-based transitions (composited, no layout shift) rather than position or margin-based transitions."
      source: "https://portent.com/blog/design-dev/how-website-carousels-impact-core-web-vitals-and-best-practices.htm"

    - title: "Web Font Swap and CLS: Fallback Metric Matching"
      summary: "DebugBear's font performance research documented that the CLS impact of web font loading depends primarily on how different the fallback font metrics are from the web font. A fallback font with very different x-height or character width causes a visible reflow when the web font loads. The CSS size-adjust descriptor (available in modern browsers) allows designers to precisely calibrate fallback font sizing to match the web font, reducing the layout shift to near zero without abandoning font-display: swap."

    - title: "Jewelry Box E-Commerce: Front-End Performance Case Study"
      summary: "Smashing Magazine published a case study on improving the performance of an online store (JewelleryBox) that documented how design-level decisions — image format choices, lazy loading implementation, carousel removal from the homepage — produced measurable Core Web Vitals improvements. The study is notable because it frames performance improvements as design decisions made by the design team, not engineering fixes applied after design was complete."
