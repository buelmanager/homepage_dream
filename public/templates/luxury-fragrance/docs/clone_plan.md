## Design Concept

**Brand Concept:**
VELLUM is a fictional haute parfumerie rooted in the intersection of raw naturalism
and alchemical precision. Each fragrance is named for a sensation, not a season.

**Visual Identity:**
- Background: Rich parchment-to-obsidian gradient (amber-dark aesthetic)
- Primary accent: Burnished amber `#C87941`
- Secondary: Sage-grey `#8A9B8E`
- Text: Warm cream `#F5F0E8`
- Dark surface: `#12100E`
- Unique feature: Ingredient scroll-reveal — botanical illustrations fade in as user scrolls

**Typography:**
- Display: DM Serif Display (elegant, editorial serif)
- Body: DM Sans (clean, refined, modern)

**Layout Innovation:**
Unlike all referenced sites (which lead with hero→product grid→brand story),
VELLUM leads with an immersive ingredient reveal before showing the collection,
creating a sensory journey rather than a shopping experience.

**Section Order (original):**
1. Preloader (amber scent-note animation)
2. Nav
3. Hero (atmospheric, no product shown)
4. Ingredient Showcase (horizontal scrolling botanicals — unique)
5. Brand Manifesto (centered editorial)
6. Collection (fragrance cards with scent-note tags)
7. Crafting Process (atelier journey)
8. Press & Recognition
9. Private Consultation (contact)
10. Footer
