## What Was Inspired (and From Where)

| Inspiration Source | What Was Observed | What We Took |
|---|---|---|
| Byredo | Minimalism, white space, ingredient focus | Philosophy of material transparency — but expressed in dark amber rather than white |
| Louis Vuitton | Heritage storytelling, atelier connection, Grasse references | The idea of a specific atelier location; rephrased around "consequence not status" |
| Creed | Personalization tools, sensory language for notes | Scent note display in collection cards (top/heart/base format) |
| Penhaligon's | Story-driven navigation, personality-led copy | Eccentric, detailed prose in product descriptions |

## What Was Changed (Divergence Points)

### Section Order — Completely Different
| Reference Pattern (all 4 brands) | VELLUM |
|---|---|
| Hero → Product Grid → Brand Story | Hero → **Ingredient Codex** (UNIQUE) → Manifesto → Collection → Process → Press → Contact |
| Product shown immediately | No product in hero — only atmosphere |
| Commerce-first | Philosophy-first |

### Color System — No Reference Match
- Creed: Minimal white/cream
- Byredo: White/grey Scandinavian
- LV: Black/gold
- Penhaligon's: Victorian jewel tones
- **VELLUM: Deep amber-obsidian `#0E0B07` — custom dark-warm palette not used by any reference**

### Typography — Original Pairing
- None of the 4 references use DM Serif Display + DM Sans
- This pairing gives editorial warmth without imitating any of the referenced brands

### Unique UI Elements Not Found in References
1. **Ingredient Codex with horizontal drag-scroll** — no reference has a dedicated, draggable ingredient showcase section
2. **Amber drop SVG preloader** — none of the references have an animated liquid-drop preloader
3. **Hero with no product** — all references show bottles in hero; VELLUM deliberately withholds the product
4. **Manifesto with atmospheric background** — an editorial section not present in any reference

### Copy Voice
- All references: product-centric ("Discover our newest collection", "Order now")
- VELLUM: consequence-focused ("We do not bottle fragrance", "This is perfumery as consequence")
- References: ingredient names as selling points
- VELLUM: ingredients as ethical provenance ("Wild-harvested · Boswellia · Socotra Island")

## Why the Final Structure Is Original

1. The section order inverts the standard luxury fragrance pattern — ingredient education before product commerce.
2. The color palette is unique among the references (dark amber is not used by any).
3. The hero contains no product imagery, which is opposite to every referenced brand.
4. The Ingredient Codex horizontal scroll is a UI pattern not found in any reference.
5. The copywriting philosophy ("perfumery as consequence, not status") is distinct from all referenced tones.
6. No brand names, logos, color codes, fonts, or text phrases from any reference were replicated.

**Verdict: Original design — not a clone of any referenced source.**
