# Originality Report — Casa Obscura (cigar-atelier)

## Concept Originality
- "Private patron cigar atelier" is an entirely novel business concept in this template library
- No existing template covers cigar, tobacco, or private membership atelier
- Deep tobacco palette (#180f08) is the darkest background value in the entire library
- Interactive mousemove parallax hero with custom branded cursor appears in no other template
- Cinzel typeface is not used in any other existing template

## Copy Originality
- All copy is original: brand name, founding year (1947), torcedores names, and locations are fictitious
- "Geneva" and "Jermyn Street, London" are real locations used fictitiously
- Cigar vitola names (Robusto, Lonsdale, Churchill) are generic industry terms (public domain)
- Leaf origin descriptions reference real growing regions but in a general educational context
