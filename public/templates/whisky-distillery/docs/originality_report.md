## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Heritage storytelling (general) | 5-generation Macrae family narrative with specific dated milestones |
| Peat flavour (industry standard) | 10,000-year peat age as geological luxury differentiator |
| Distillery architecture | "Built in 1893. Unchanged by design." — the refusal to change is the brand statement |
| Wine AOC terroir model | Highland water source + altitude + peat bog geography as flavour system |
| Alchemical whisky branding | Shifted to geological metaphor: extraction vs. distillation |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- "Extraction not distillation" — geological metaphor not seen in any whisky brand
- 10,000-year peat age as the primary luxury proof point (older than any bottle, any distillery, any civilization)
- Solera vatting since 1960 — a continuous vessel never emptied since Kennedy's inauguration
- Private Cask Programme with name inscribed in stone above the cask
- "Six Acts of Transformation" process framing — theatrical language applied to industrial process
- Geological origin story: Devonian-bedrock warehouses breathing in sync with casks

## Brand Fiction Note
"Cragmòr" is a fictional brand. The Macrae family, the Braeswick burn, all personnel, cask numbers,
and the Caithness plateau distillery are invented. No real whisky brand by this name exists.
