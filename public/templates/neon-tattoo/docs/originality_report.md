# Originality Report — Voltage Ink (neon-tattoo)

## Brand

- **Brand name:** Voltage Ink — original (references the building's electrical history and the neon aesthetic)
- **Founder:** Ryo Kessler — fictional character (Japanese first name, German surname — hybrid background)
- **Tagline:** "Fine Art Tattooing Under the Neon" — original
- **Neon Irezumi concept:** original positioning (combination of traditional Japanese tattooing with UV-reactive inks)

## Visual Design

- Color palette: Original near-black + three simultaneous neon accents — this specific combination does not exist in any reference brand
- Grid hero (Type E): Original implementation — six-cell image grid with center overlay box
- Per-card neon colour assignment on collection grid: original interaction design
- Image saturation filter reveal on hover: original technique applied at this scale

## Copy

All body copy is 100% original. The UV ink safety language (EU-certified, long-term biocompatibility data) is inspired by real-world ink safety practices but all specific claims are fictional.

## Images

All images from confirmed-valid Unsplash ID list. Images used as contextual / atmospheric — none represent actual tattoo work (avoiding any potential misrepresentation).

## Code

- CSS architecture: Original — distinctly different from both raw-honey and sea-salt-atelier
- Fonts: Entirely different from other two pages (Bebas Neue + DM Serif Display + Space Grotesk)
- Hero: Type E grid implementation — entirely different from Type B (raw-honey) and Type D (sea-salt-atelier)
- Neon glow CSS shadows: original technique in this project's context

## Verdict

Original luxury landing page. Takes inspiration from the high-end tattoo studio category (Bang Bang, Dr. Woo) but copies no structure, copy, visual identity, or code from any existing brand.
