# Clone Plan — Voltage Ink (neon-tattoo)

## Reference Research

- **Bang Bang NYC** — high-end tattoo studio, celebrity clientele positioning
- **Dr. Woo** — fine line luxury tattoo, editorial brand identity
- **Grime London** — dark luxury tattoo studio aesthetic
- **Sang Bleu** — art-world crossover tattoo positioning

## Design Decisions

### Why Grid Hero (Type E)?
A tattoo studio's primary product is visual. The most powerful hero for this brand is not a single image but a wall of work — which creates the immediate impression of depth and range. The grid also references the studio's electric substation architecture: rows of identical panels containing contained energy.

### Three Neon Colours Simultaneously
Most luxury brands use one accent colour for coherence. Voltage Ink uses three (pink, cyan, violet) because the brand's subject matter — neon light — inherently involves multiple simultaneous wavelengths. Using a single colour would contradict the visual argument the brand is making.

### Bebas Neue + DM Serif Display Contrast
The pairing is deliberately schizophrenic. Bebas Neue is industrial, masculine, urban — it reads like a sign from the outside of the building. DM Serif Display is elegant, literary, art-world — it reads like the catalogue inside. Together they say: "we are as culturally serious as we are visually intense."

### "Book" Not "Shop"
Voltage Ink uses commission/booking language throughout, never e-commerce language. This positions the studio as a fine art atelier, not a retail service — appropriate for the price point and cultural positioning implied.

### Saturation Reduction on Images
All portfolio images use `filter: saturate(0.6-0.8)` in their rest state, revealing full saturation only on hover. This creates a dramatic reveal effect that is consistent with the brand's neon philosophy: colour that has to be activated, not passively consumed.
