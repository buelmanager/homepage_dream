# Originality Report — Vitrara Atelier (glass-blowing)

## References Analyzed
1. ESQUE Studio — product-forward gallery, minimal dark aesthetic, "heirloom" language
2. VIZ Art Glass — gallery/collector positioning, white background, academic voice
3. Atelier Modern / Glassware collections — lifestyle photography, gifting framing, curated neutrals

## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Gallery/collector aesthetic | Repositioned as studio-first: the furnace and process are the product, not the object |
| White/neutral palette | Inverted to furnace-dark — glass is shown in its making context, not a boutique setting |
| Product grid | Collection cards with vertical offset transforms — objects feel suspended in heat |
| Press/review format | Named "Luminaries" — testimonials presented as literary observations, not endorsements |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- Animated flame preloader (CSS radial gradient + keyframe dance) — no SVG dependency
- Temperature labels on each process step (1,200°C → 480°C) — process presented as precision craft
- "A single breath per piece" as the primary luxury differentiator — irreversibility as brand value
- Furnace temperature badge embedded in the philosophy image (1,200°C working temp)
- Commission copy: "A piece made for one room" — spatial specificity, not product sales
- 9-year continuous furnace operation as heritage claim — the fire has never gone cold
- Atelier specs (2,000lb batch, 18hr anneal cycle) as luxury credentials

## Brand Fiction Note
"Vitrara Atelier" and all commission clients, staff, and specifications are entirely fictional. No real glass studio by this name exists.
