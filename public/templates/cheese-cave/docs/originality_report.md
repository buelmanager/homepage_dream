# Originality Report — Grotte Dorée

## Reference Sites Analyzed
1. lafromagerie.co.uk — quiet luxury, navy/cream, provenance storytelling
2. murrayscheese.com — modernized heritage, red accent, educational content
3. miticafoods.com — clean import positioning, multi-category cohesion

## Elements Inspired By (and Transformed)
| Inspiration | Original Transformation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Wine cellar aesthetic (general) | Applied to cheese with geological + philosophical language |
| Terroir concept (wine industry) | "Terroir of Stone" — cave as origin story, not vineyard |
| Murray's educational angle | Affinage timeline as 5-stage narrative arc |
| Luxury dark UI (perfume industry) | Adapted for food culture with cave-specific texture |

## Original Elements (No Precedent Found)
- "Cave as protagonist" concept — the atelier is the star, not the product
- Aging stage as 5-chapter story with flavor arc (Salage → Révélation)
- Floating atmospheric stats in hero (temperature/humidity as poetry)
- Stone spine timeline animation synced to scroll position
- Geological time as luxury differentiator vs. conventional rustic aesthetic

## Why This Is Original
Grotte Dorée occupies a space no competitor does: the intersection of dark luxury aesthetics
(borrowed from perfume and spirits), geological/scientific language (cave metrics as art direction),
and philosophical cheese positioning (cheese as revealed, not made). The visual identity,
brand voice, section structure, and interaction patterns are entirely bespoke.

## Brand Fiction Note
"Grotte Dorée" is a fictional brand. No real affinage producer with this name exists.
All copy, quotes, statistics, and personnel names are invented for demonstration purposes.
