# Originality Report — Ensho (tea-ceremony)

## References Analyzed
1. Mariage Frères — antiquarian warmth, French-intellectual tone, encyclopedic product depth
2. TWG Tea — jewel-box luxury, gold/black palette, hotel-lobby atmosphere, gifting positioning
3. 12 Matcha / Base Design — gradient-led system, transformation metaphors, avoids green cliché

## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Heritage narrative | Replaced with instrument-first page hierarchy — tools before beverage |
| Gifting/experience framing | Reframed as "a practice, not a purchase" — session booking replaces e-commerce |
| Matcha green palette | Completely absent — color drawn from ceramics, ash, and ink only |
| Product grid | Asymmetric masonry with tall-card feature — instruments as sculptural objects |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- Enso (brushstroke circle) as animated SVG identity mark — completes on page load
- Horizontal-scroll origin stories with GPS coordinates and soil-derived color swatches
- Haiku-length copy constraint: all section headers ≤17 syllables
- Three ceremony formats named I/II/III (Roman) positioned as "three ways to be present" — not tiers
- No green in palette — Sumi Black / Celadon Ash / Rusted Ochre palette drawn from raku-fired ceramics
- "Enter into correspondence with Ensho" — newsletter framed as exchange, not marketing
- Process timeline with Japanese kanji numerals (一二三四五) as dot labels

## Brand Fiction Note
"Ensho" and all session formats, origin sourcing details, and personnel are entirely fictional. No real tea atelier by this name exists.
