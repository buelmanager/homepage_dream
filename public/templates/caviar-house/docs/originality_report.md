# Originality Report — Oscietra Noir (caviar-house)

## References Analyzed
1. Caviar House (Heathrow / Calder Moore) — heritage retail, oval transitions
2. The Caviar Co. — pairing culture, approachable luxury
3. AKI Caviar — minimalist Japanese-European, extreme restraint

## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Heritage tasting notes | Rewritten as poetry ("Dark ocean. Cedar smoke. A memory of salt.") |
| Wine terroir model | Applied to caviar water origins as distinct flavour systems |
| Luxury pairing culture | Reduced to noun-pairs ("Oscietra Noir. Billecart-Salmon.") |
| Private allocation | No form — Concierge section with email only, personal response implied |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- "Time as the core equity" — brand voice owns the dimension of time
- Harvest-year transparency modeled on wine vintages
- Poetry tasting notes — not specs, but sensory haiku
- The Concierge: a section with no form, just an email — maximum friction removal
- Water origin as the primary luxury credential, not species or grade
- "Each tin is a timestamp" — philosophical reframe of product as chronicle

## Brand Fiction Note
"Oscietra Noir" and "Maison Leclair" are fictional. All water sources are real geographies but the cultivation operations are invented. No real caviar brand by this name exists.
