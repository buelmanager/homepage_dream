# Originality Report — Shizuku (matcha-cafe)

## References Analyzed
1. 12 Matcha by Base Design — minimalist greens, multi-sensory universe
2. Matcha Kari — clean product photography, zen lifestyle
3. Yoshi Matcha Liqueur by Saint-Urbain — behavior over iconography

## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|--------------------|
| Japanese ritual (general) | "60s directed stillness" as brand promise, not decor |
| Wine terroir narrative | Single-origin tea with named farms + flavor arc |
| Dark luxury (perfume sector) | Applied to tea ceremony as anti-wellness statement |
| Heritage storytelling | 7-generation lineage from 1852 with specific milestones |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- "The Pause" as commercial proposition (60s silence requirement)
- Floating kanji (静/茶) as atmospheric decoration, not cultural signaling
- Five-terroir origin timeline maps specific Japanese prefectures
- Dark forest green (#1F2820) vs. typical wellness-green aesthetics
- "Still. Green. Perfect." — three-word manifesto as headline punctuated with dots

## Brand Fiction Note
"Shizuku" is a fictional brand. The Nakamura family farm narrative, ceremony format, pricing, and all personnel are invented. No real matcha brand by this name exists.
