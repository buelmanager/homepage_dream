# Originality Report — Sigillum & Co. (wax-seal-atelier)

## References Analyzed
1. Artisaire — wax seals as modern stationery, bright/clean aesthetic, DIY wedding market
2. Nostalgic Impressions — historical heraldic seals, museum-tone copy, slow-craft messaging
3. The Stamp Maker / Bespoke Post — subscription/gifting framing, product-forward grids

## Inspirations Transformed
| Source | Original Treatment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Heraldic tradition | Roman numeral (I–IV) process steps as legal/archival ritual language |
| Wax as wedding trend | Repositioned as private correspondence for legacy families, not events |
| Product grid layout | Masonry gallery with varied row spans — wax seals as sculptural objects |
| Testimonials as reviews | Testimonials styled as physical correspondence letters — serif italic, envelope framing |

## Genuinely Original Elements
- "Every letter a covenant. Every seal, a legacy." — positions the act of sealing as civic/legal not decorative
- Deep archival crimson `#2E1A1A` as primary bg — sealing wax red as environment, not accent
- Correspondence Kit as a standalone service tier (bespoke kit for ongoing letter-writing life)
- Testimonials presented as letter excerpts with sender initial + provenance city (Edinburgh, Rome, Kyoto)
- Four wax compounds named by character: "Archival Rouge", "Soot Black", "Bone & Ivory", "Viridian Study"
- Commission form with "Occasion" selector (First Correspondence, Family Crest, Diplomatic Gift, Memorial)

## Brand Fiction Note
"Sigillum & Co." and all personnel, clients, and commission details are entirely fictional. No real wax seal atelier by this name exists.
