# Originality Report — KIRI Japanese Sake Experience

## Reference Sites Studied
1. Sake Social (sakesocial.com) — UK sake bars
2. Kanpai London (kanpailondon.com) — sake and Japanese spirits
3. Haiku (haikurestaurant.co.uk) — Japanese aesthetic dining
4. Nishiki Market stalls in Kyoto — physical retail reference

## Inspired Elements & Changes Made

| Reference Element | Inspired By | Changes Made |
|---|---|---|
| Sake-focused curation | Kanpai London | Positioned as "sanctuary" not bar; added ritual framework |
| Japanese character accents | General Japanese branding | Used kanji as semantic content (ma/umami/satoyama) not decoration |
| Dark earthy palette | Wabi-sabi interior refs | Warmer beige-gold accent vs typical red/black Japanese branding |
| Tasting menu format | Fine dining references | Reframed as "five movements" — musical analogy unique to KIRI |

## Original Elements
- **Brand name "KIRI" (霧):** Completely fictional — "mist" chosen for evocative quality
- **Diagonal split hero (clip-path polygon):** Not used by any reference site
- **"Five Movements" service framework:** Original choreographic metaphor
- **Kanji in philosophy section:** 間 / 旨 / 里 used as structural dividers — original application
- **Koshu Archive concept:** Europe's first curated vertical aged sake archive — fictional but original
- **Hana Kimura founder story:** Entirely original character and narrative
- **Image desaturation:** Applying `filter: saturate(0.8)` globally — original visual decision
- **Press quotes:** All three entirely original, not sourced from anywhere
